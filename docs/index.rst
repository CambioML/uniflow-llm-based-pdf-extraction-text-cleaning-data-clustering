Welcome to uniflow!
===================================

**uniflow** is an open-source python library for ML scientists and practitioners.
**uniflow** helps you quickly prepare LLM finetuning data, from your private and unstructured data including PDFs, HTMLs, PPTs, Images, etc. With the :ref:`ExtractFlow` and :ref:`TransformFlow`, you can easily extract and chunk text, generate questions and answers, summarize text, etc. for preparing your private LLMs finetuning. You can further streamline your process by combining these flows into a :ref:`MultiFlowsPipeline`. Finally, with the :ref:`Rater` you can easily evaluate the performance of your LLMs.
