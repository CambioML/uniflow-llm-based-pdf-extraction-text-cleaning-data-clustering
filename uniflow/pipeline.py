    """
    A queue-based pipeline to handle multiple processes for Uniflow,
    including a consumer thread and a producer thread. The Producer/Consumer
    pattern decouples processes that produce and consume data at different
    rates.

    The Producer thread is responsible for putting items into the queue if
    it is not full, while the Consumer thread consumes items if there are any.

    Both threads run indefinitely while checking the status of the queue.
    The Producer thread will stop once it has finished putting all the items
    into the queue. The Consumer thread will stop once it has consumed all
    the items from the queue.
