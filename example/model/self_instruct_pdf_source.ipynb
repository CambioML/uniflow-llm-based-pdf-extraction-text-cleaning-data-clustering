       "[Context(context='11/6/23, 11:40 AM Maker\\'s Schedule, Manager\\'s Schedule\\nhttps://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html 1/3\\n\"...the mere consciousness of an engagement will sometimes\\nworry a whole da y.\"\\n– Charles Dick ens\\nJuly 2009\\nOne reason progr ammers dislik e meetings so much is that they\\'re\\non a different t ype of schedule from other people. Meetings cost\\nthem more.\\nThere are two t ypes of schedule, which I\\'ll call the manager\\'s\\nschedule and the mak er\\'s schedule. The manager\\'s schedule is for\\nbosses. It\\'s embodied in the tr aditional appointment book, with\\neach da y cut into one hour interv als. Y ou can block off sev eral\\nhours for a single task if y ou need to , but b y default y ou change\\nwhat y ou\\'re doing ev ery hour .\\nWhen y ou use time that w ay, it\\'s merely a pr actical problem to\\nmeet with someone. Find an open slot in y our schedule, book\\nthem, and y ou\\'re done.\\nMost powerful people are on the manager\\'s schedule. It\\'s the\\nschedule of command. But there\\'s another w ay of using time\\nthat\\'s common among people who mak e things, lik e progr ammers\\nand writers. They gener ally prefer to use time in units of half a\\nday at least. Y ou can\\'t write or progr am well in units of an hour .\\nThat\\'s barely enough time to get started.\\nWhen y ou\\'re oper ating on the mak er\\'s schedule, meetings are a\\ndisaster . A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, b y\\nbreaking it into two pieces each too small to do an ything hard in.\\nPlus y ou ha ve to remember to go to the meeting. That\\'s no\\nproblem for someone on the manager\\'s schedule. There\\'s alw ays\\nsomething coming on the next hour; the only question is what.\\nBut when someone on the mak er\\'s schedule has a meeting, they\\nhave to think about it.\\nFor someone on the mak er\\'s schedule, ha ving a meeting is lik e\\nthrowing an ex ception. It doesn\\'t merely cause y ou to switch\\nfrom one task to another; it changes the mode in which y ou\\nwork.\\nI find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole da y. A meeting\\ncommonly blows at least half a da y, by breaking up a morning or\\nafternoon. But in addition there\\'s sometimes a cascading effect. If\\nI know the afternoon is going to be brok en up , I\\'m slightly less\\nlikely to start something ambitious in the morning. I know this\\nmay sound o versensitiv e, but if y ou\\'re a mak er, think of y our own\\ncase. Don\\'t y our spirits rise at the thought of ha ving an entire da y\\nfree to work, with no appointments at all? W ell, that means y our\\nspirits are correspondingly depressed when y ou don\\'t. And\\nambitious projects are b y definition close to the limits of y our')]"
