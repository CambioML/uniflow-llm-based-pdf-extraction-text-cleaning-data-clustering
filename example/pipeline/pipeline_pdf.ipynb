Within natural language processing, much of the work with deep learning methods has involved learning word vector representations through neural language models [1, 1, 2] and performing composition over the learned word vectors for classification [1]. Word vectors, wherein words are projected from a sparse, 1-of-\\(V\\) encoding (here \\(V\\) is the vocabulary size) onto a lower dimensional vector space via a hidden layer, are essentially feature extractors that encode semantic features of words in their dimensions. In such dense representations, semantically close words are likewise close--in euclidean or cosine distance--in the lower dimensional vector space.</td>\n",

Despite little tuning of hyperparameters, this simple model achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks, suggesting that the pre-trained vectors are 'universal' feature extractors that can be utilized for various classification tasks. Learning task-specific vectors through fine-tuning results in further improvements.

       "7                                                         Deep learning models have achieved remarkable results in computer vision [11] and speech recognition [1] in recent years. Within natural language processing, much of the work with deep learning methods has involved learning word vector representations through neural language models [1, 1, 2] and performing composition over the learned word vectors for classification [1]. Word vectors, wherein words are projected from a sparse, 1-of-\\(V\\) encoding (here \\(V\\) is the vocabulary size) onto a lower dimensional vector space via a hidden layer, are essentially feature extractors that encode semantic features of words in their dimensions. In such dense representations, semantically close words are likewise close--in euclidean or cosine distance--in the lower dimensional vector space.                                                                 What are the main applications of deep learning models?   \n",

Originally invented for computer vision, CNN models have subsequently been shown to be effective for NLP and have achieved excellent results in semantic parsing [13], search query retrieval [2], sentence modeling [1], and other traditional NLP tasks [1].                                 What are some of the tasks for which CNN models have achieved excellent results in NLP?   \n",
       "9   In the present work, we train a simple CNN with one layer of convolution on top of word vectors obtained from an unsupervised neural language model. These vectors were trained by Mikolov et al. (2013) on 100 billion words of Google News, and are publicly available.1 We initially keep the word vectors static and learn only the other parameters of the model. Despite little tuning of hyperparameters, this simple model achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks, suggesting that the pre-trained vectors are 'universal' feature extractors that can be utilized for various classification tasks. Learning task-specific vectors through fine-tuning results in further improvements. We finally describe a simple modification to the architecture to allow for the use of both pre-trained and task-specific vectors by having multiple channels.                                Who trained the word vectors used in the simple CNN model described in the present work?   \n",
