       "['# Pinduoduo (Nasdaq: PDD)\\n\\nPinduoduo is the third largest ecommerce platform in China. We believe the stock is under-\\nvalued, as PDD is now trading at ~10.4x EV/FCF (adjusted for stock-based comp) or ~6.4x EV\\n/ FCF on 2025 estimates. This valuation seems far too cheap, for a company who is growing\\ncurrent revenues at +65% y/y (as of Q3 2022), expected to grow top-line at ~24% y/y over the\\nnext three years, and where we expect operating income to 2 - 3x over the same timeframe¹.\\n\\nIt seems the basis of this opportunity, lies in the investment community\\'s broad aversion to\\nChinese equities (especially internet companies), in addition to several company specific\\nconcerns:\\n\\n1. The Recent Chinese Equity Sell-off is Due to Politics, Not Fundamentals: At the\\nlowest point on Oct 24th, PDD\\'s stock price was down by -34% in a single day, due to\\nforeign capital fleeing the Chinese equity markets after the President Xi\\'s \"landslide\"\\nreelection victory and the appointment of his loyalists to the Politburo Standing\\nCommittee. Foreign investors feared that this consolidation of power would mark the\\nbeginning of China\\'s changing stance towards capitalism.\\n\\nIn contrast, we feel that these issues have been well communicated for years (it was\\nexpected that Xi would receive a 3rd term since 2018, for example), and don\\'t signify a\\ndeviation from previously announced Party goals. In fact, we thought the event may\\nactually give Xi more leeway to aggressively pursue the needs / betterment of Chinese\\nsociety & economy, without having to worry about his political position or competing\\nfactions within the CCP.\\n\\nAfter Oct 24th, we indeed saw a flood of positive news - from support of China\\'s real\\nestate sector, to loosening of China\\'s zero-Covid policy, to improving relations with\\nforeign countries.\\n\\n2.\\nLack of Communication with Investors: Pinduoduo has long been an enigma for the\\ninvestment community. The company hasn\\'t had a CFO for years, refuses to provide\\ngranular disclosure for the analyst community, and doesn\\'t break out its different business\\nsegments in an easily understandable format.\\n\\nFor example, Pinduoduo\\'s grocery business line segment results are hidden within its\\n\"Transaction Services\" revenue line. The company also just launched Temu (its\\ninternational business), but doesn\\'t provide investors with any information regarding its\\nbusiness strategy / planned investments within the division. On earnings calls, the\\n\\n1. The exact magnitude depends on the timing of Duoduo grocery reaching profitability, and the degree of investment spend into Temu.\\n\\nHAYDEN CAPITAL\\n\\n1',\n",
       " 'management team even deliberately answers most analyst questions with a seemingly\\nscripted answer, often simply reiterating what it\\'s already stated in past calls.\\n\\nBecause of this, the company\\'s earnings results have always deviated materially from the\\nmarket\\'s consensus (and often to the upside). This lack of transparency and concerns\\nabout corporate governance have prevented some investors from investing in the\\ncompany.\\n\\nHowever in our view, just because a company doesn\\'t give investors disclosure doesn\\'t\\nnecessarily mean they don\\'t care about investors. In order to understand management\\'s\\nthinking, we have to analyze past actions instead of what they say to ensure the correct\\ndecisions were made. Analyzing current initiatives requires more effort on the investor\\'s\\npart, and requires deeper analysis to break-down how the business\\' true financial\\ncondition, in addition to primary research to source our own information (versus simply\\nrelying upon company guidance).\\n\\n3. Growth Ceiling Concerns: As Pinduoduo approaches 900M active buyers, which\\ncaptures almost all of China\\'s mobile internet users, there\\'s concerns that the company\\'s\\nroom for growth within China is shrinking. In addition, PDD\\'s take-rate is starting to\\nexceed Alibaba\\'s, which calls into question just how much higher it can go.\\nInvestors have historically viewed BABA\\'s take-rates as the \"ceiling\" in China\\'s\\necommerce industry. However, we view this as an arbitrary limit - especially since China\\nhas one of the lowest ecommerce take-rates globally (historically due to the intense\\ncompetition between the large ecommerce platforms). We think this is shifting, and take-\\nrates can continue to rise as long as Pinduoduo can provide more value to merchants,\\nthan what they capture-back in the form of commissions & ads. We\\'ll discuss this in\\nmore detail below.\\n\\n4. Fears that Strong Results are Temporary: There are concerns that Q2 & Q3 2022\\'s\\nimpressive results are from one-off windfalls and won\\'t be sustainable. The fear is that\\nmerchants\\' urgent needs for destocking during a period of overall weak Chinese\\neconomic consumption, allowed PDD to command higher take rates (via increased\\nmerchant advertising). Additionally, PDD skews toward lower tier cities, where users\\nwere proportionally less exposed to COVID lock downs.\\n\\nWhile these concerns are valid, we don\\'t believe it impairs PDD\\'s long-term thesis. The\\ncompany is increasing its mix of high-value / branded items, which is allowing it to court\\nhigher-tier residents. Additionally we believe that with the 2nd largest consumer base,\\nmerchants will be inclined to spend an increasing amount of their advertising budget to\\nreach these users. Pinduoduo is actively creating value for merchant\\'s businesses (and\\nthus expanding merchant\\'s margin profiles), as we\\'ll describe below. This incremental\\nvalue operates in a \"closed-loop\", is then recaptured by the platform.',\n",
       " '# Business Overview\\n\\nPinduoduo was launched in 2015, and over the last seven years has quickly ramped up its user\\npool to 900 million users. It\\'s now the third largest e-commerce platform in China in terms of\\nGMV, with ~24% market share.\\n\\nInstead of competing head-to-head with Alibaba and JD\\'s search-based platforms, PDD focused\\non creating an interactive and entertaining platform. A search-based shopping experience is\\nwhere a customer already wants to buy a specific item, and then searches different varieties /\\nprices for that particular item on the platform.\\n\\nPinduoduo\\'s model is based on entertaining users and giving them the chance to get deep\\ndiscounts instead. The user behavior differs, since customers log onto the platform without a\\nspecific item in mind - only logging on out of boredom or to see what deals are available that\\nday.\\n\\nThe best analogy is like that of a \"sushi conveyor belt\" (LINK). Deeply-discounted, \"deals of the\\nday\" items are shown on the app, and users scroll down the page only until they find something\\nthat catches their eye. The discounts and items on sale differ every day, so users never know\\nwhat they\\'ll find when they log on next (making it a fun, \"treasure-hunt\" experience). There were\\nalso daily check-in rewards and mini-games, where users could earn rewards and get free items or\\nadditional discounts on the site, thus encouraging frequent engagement.\\n\\nThis is compared to a search-oriented platform, which is like a traditional store - items sit on a\\nshelf, and customers browse the aisles looking for what they need. The items offered don\\'t\\nchange much over time, so customers can shop at the store reliably.\\n\\nKey to its meteoric rise, is also PDD\\'s innovative \"team purchase model\". In the early days,\\nusers could either pay full-price or receive a discount when they \"teamed-up\" with other users\\nto\\npurchase together. All the buyers needed to complete the purchase within 24 hours, or else have\\nthe entire group\\'s order canceled. This incentivized users to quickly invite friends and family\\n(often through WeChat groups), to get the same great deal together. These new users would then\\ninvite additional people within their WeChat friends list, as they formed their own groups for\\nadditional purchases.\\n\\nWith the team purchase model providing large bulk-orders within a condensed time frame, this\\nthen allowed PDD to use these aggregated orders to go directly to manufacturers through a\\nconsumer-to-manufacturer model (\"C2M\"). PDD partnered directly with millions of factories,\\nwho traditionally manufactured items for national and foreign brands. PDD could provide the\\norder sizes required to justify having a separate \"white-label\" production line for the platform,\\nwhile also allowing factories to cut out several layers of middlemen and thus realize higher profit\\nmargins on the sales channel (we\\'ll discuss this more later).\\n\\nAlso since items are sold on a \"deal of the day\" basis, users don\\'t expect the same SKUs to\\nalways be available on the platform. As such, factories could run PDD specific production-lines\\nonly when they had excess capacity. Factories received the group-orders beforehand, so they\\nknew exactly many items to produce (reducing wasted inventory), and also meant PDD didn\\'t',\n",
       " \"need to hold inventory (since orders are shipped directly to the buyer's home, vs. sitting in a\\nwarehouse waiting to be sold).\\n\\nThis provided PDD with a structural price advantage, due to the ability to cut out all the middle-\\nmen distribution layers, and resulting in the cheapest price possible. It's this value-for-money\\nfocus that differentiated it from other e-commerce names - especially among value-seeking\\ncustomers, within Chinese lower-tier cities.\\n\\n**Pinduoduo Now Has Similar Number of Active Buyers as Alibaba**\\n*Source: Company filings; Hayden estimates*\\n\\n| | PDD | BABA | JD |\\n|-|-|-|-|\\n| 2013 | - | - | - |\\n| 2014 | - | - | - |\\n| 2015 | - | - | - |\\n| 2016 | - | - | 419 |\\n| 2017 | - | - | 585 |\\n| 2018 | 869 | 788 | - |\\n| 2019 | 882 | - | - |\\n| 2020 | 892 | - | - |\\n| 2021 | - | - | - |\\n| 1Q22 | - | - | - |\\n| 2Q22 | - | - | - |\\n\\n**PDD's Captured % Share of Incremental GMV**\\n*Source: Company filings; Hayden estimates; NBS Data*\\n\\n| Year | Incremental GMV |\\n|-|-|\\n| 2018 | 19% |\\n| 2019 | 33% |\\n| 2020 | 59% |\\n| 2021 | 58% |\\n| 1Q22 | 18% |\\n| 2Q22 | 57% |\\n\\nIn addition, PDD wisely leveraged its partnership with Tencent in the early days, benefiting from\\nthe cheap traffic WeChat provided. PDD utilized social interactions and viral marketing, which\\nencouraged users to share deals among their friends group-chats, which in turn accelerated\",\n",
       " \"## platform trust in the early days\\n\\nThis user engagement from social sharing on WeChat allowed PDD to ramp up its users quickly.\\n\\nNowadays, the platform has created its own captive user base and is less dependent upon Tencent traffic, as it has greatly matured after 2019. However, this growth-hack was key to its rapid growth in its early days.\\n\\nAdditionally, PDD's early success can be attributed to it targeting an under-penetrated ecommerce segment - users in lower-tier cities. Whereas Alibaba and JD both traditionally focused on Tier 1 & 2 consumers with higher disposable incomes and technology familiarity, they both missed the early trend that was happening in lower tier cities with the rise of smartphones. Combined with the seamlessness of Alipay & WeChat pay, online shopping suddenly became accessible to everyone with a cheap Android smartphone between 2010 - 2015.\\n\\nThese cities tend to have fewer entertainment options, so users spent more time engaged on their phones. They also had lower-disposable income, which meant many were willing to expend extra effort to get a great deal (such as sharing & promoting deals within group chats or playing games for discounts).\\n\\nThese users were unique to PDD, and exhibited higher stickiness versus other cohorts. Today, users order from the platform an average of ~6.5x per month, and it's this stickiness that has allowed the company to retain ~900M users without much incremental marketing.\\n\\nIn recent years, PDD has expanded its users to higher tier cities. Together with these deal-seekers, the platform has captured the majority of China's incremental ecommerce sales. In just a couple years, PDD has changed the competitive landscape in Chinese ecommerce, with Alibaba being the primary share donor.\\n\\n![China Ecommerce Market Share](https://i.imgur.com/L7aGOVt.png)\\nSource: Company filings; MS estimation on BABA GMV; NBS Data; Top 3 GMV exceeds NBS e-commerce sales as GMV includes returns and unfilled orders\",\n",
       " \"In the immediate future, PDD's core business is going to be driven by three primary tailwinds:\\n\\n1. Factories are over-supplied, and brands need to destock inventory. This leads to brands increasingly willing to try new channels (especially those with large captive user bases), and ultimately drives advertising revenue as merchants spend to gain user attention on these platforms.\\n\\n2. China's economic growth is slowing, which will encourage consumers to seek out more value-for-money shopping opportunities. Pinduoduo specializes in white-label products, that are at significant discounts to branded items. It's particularly strong in daily goods / household items that have high repeat purchase rates, and the average order is just $6 USD.\\n\\n3. Lower-tier cities will exhibit stronger consumption growth going forward. Any incremental new users will likely come from these regions, as recommerce is already mature within larger cities. Additionally, lower-tier cities comprise >70% of China's population, and >60% of its GDP (LINK). Brands are also starting to focus on this segment too, exemplified by the marketing term 'Xiachen' (Fir) - meaning downward marketing, or specifically targeting users in lower-tier cities as opportunities are exhausted in more populous cities.\\n\\nOn top of PDD's core ecommerce business, the company also launched an online grocery business (group-purchase model) in Q4 2020. When it first launched, Duoduo Grocery faced competition from all of the major Chinese tech giants (Alibaba, JD, Meituan, etc.). However in just two years, Duoduo Grocery has proved itself to be the winner of this trillion RMB market, with the highest market share and with the other players retrenching in defeat.\\n\\nWe will discuss this development in depth below, and why Duoduo Grocery could be an overlooked valuation-driver over the next few years.\\n\\n## Pinduoduo's Business Model\\n\\nPinduoduo's business consists of primarily two segments: the core ecommerce platform, and Duoduo Grocery. Duoduo Grocery hasn't turned a profit yet, so the company's profits today are entirely driven by the ecommerce business.\\n\\nPDD also launched Temu, it's international business, in September 2022 (LINK). It's still very small, but will comprise a third segment going forward. While it's still too early to estimate the future of this new initiative (i.e. the magnitude of GMV or revenue contribution), we do have some insight into its budgeted capex plans which we'll discuss later.\",\n",

       " '# PDD\\'s GMV is a function of Average Order Value (AOV) X Order Frequency X Number of\\nActive Customers.\\n\\nThe company\\'s AOV is structurally lower than competitors, consistently ~ RMB 40 - 50 per\\norder. Alibaba meanwhile has an AOV ~RMB 95, and JD\\'s AOV is ~RMB 400¹. There are\\na\\nfew reasons for this:\\n\\n1. PDD doesn\\'t have a shopping cart function. There is simply one item per order, while\\ncompeting platforms have multiples items in an order. This feature incentives consumers\\nto make purchases quicker (and occasionally on impulse), increasing conversion, and\\nlower the risk of shopping cart abandonment.\\n\\nAdditionally, this makes sense for PDD\\'s business model, as the company doesn\\'t hold\\ninventory and is not responsible for fulfillment. Once an order is placed and confirmed\\nwith the merchant, the merchant is the one who handles the fulfillment and then utilizes\\n3rd party logistics providers to deliver the package to the buyer. Since each item is likely\\ncoming from a different merchant anyways, there wouldn\\'t be any benefit to grouping\\nitems in a shopping cart.\\n\\n2. PDD\\'s average selling price (ASP) is generally lower than similar products on Alibaba\\'s\\nsites, or JD. This is since PDD focuses on working directly with factories, to sell \"while\\nlabel\" goods, or items that are manufactured directly by factories without the added\\nexpense of a brand or the marketing costs associated with it.\\n\\nThis PDD - manufacturer relationship is what differentiates the platform, as multiple\\nlayers of middlemen and brand-related expenses are saved, by working directly with the\\nmanufacturer. PDD creates value for these manufacturers, by offering them a direct\\nchannel & relationship with the end-customer, that these manufacturers didn\\'t have\\nbefore. By working with factories to reduce the price, this also fulfills the primary\\nattribute PDD\\'s customers come to the platform for - \"value-for-money\".\\n\\n3. PDD also has a different category mix than competitors. The most popular categories\\nare lower ASP, such as groceries, daily home goods, and apparel. Meanwhile, the\\nplatform trails in high-priced categories, such as appliances and beauty.\\n\\nThe company has recently been adopting strategies to increase it\\'s AOV, and is making a\\npush to attract more brands (versus the traditional white-label factories). At the same\\ntime though, it has stuck with its core value proposition of being a platform that offers\\nthe best value for cost-conscious shoppers.\\n\\nFor example, we recently checked 20 of the highest-ranked premium / luxury brands\\nacross Alibaba\\'s categories, and found that half of these had also opened flagship stores\\non PDD. We believe this is in-line with PDD courting more users from higher-tier cities,\\nand is starting to position PDD as a destination for shoppers of all types who are looking\\nfor a good deal.\\n\\n¹ Alibaba stated in 2018 that annual active customers spend ~RMB 9,000 per year, across 92 orders.\\n\\nHAYDEN CAPITAL\\n\\n8',\n",

Since PDD doesn\\'t handle\\ndelivery or fulfillment for its core ecommerce business, it\\'s obvious that these cost items are\\nattributable to Duoduo Grocery6.\\n\\nWithin this period, RMB 21.3BN was used for fulfillment, logistics and warehousing for the\\ngrocery business. In addition, PDD spent ~5 - 10% the grocery GMV, as a commission for\\ngrocery group purchase leaders (essentially local PDD ambassadors, who promoted & took\\norders). This equated to ~RMB 5BN. Finally the other costs are for bandwidth / traffic and\\noverhead, and which needs to be allocated between the core ecommerce and grocery divisions.\\n\\n6 PDD very briefly experimented with 1P sales. But this really only lasted a few quarters, peaking in Q4 2020. So some of these costs are also\\nassociated with that business, but it\\'s not meaningful today (and yet these fulfillment costs have continued to increase, indicating the bulk is\\nfor\\ngrocery).\\n\\nHAYDEN CAPITAL\\n\\n10']"
