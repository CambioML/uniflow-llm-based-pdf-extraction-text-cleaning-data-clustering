    "# Generate QAs from Unstructured Data Using AWS Inferentia and Neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you a machine learning (ML) professional grappling with the challenge of extracting high-quality data from confidential and unstructured formats such as PDFs and HTML? The task of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often requires dealing with such complex data, which poses significant challenges in terms of data privacy, processing efficiency, and model accuracy.\n",
    "In this example, we will show you how to generate question-answers (QAs) from give text strings using open-source models via uniflow's [HuggingFaceModelFlow](https://github.com/CambioML/uniflow/blob/main/uniflow/flow/transform/transform_huggingface_flow.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "This article provides a comprehensive guide on leveraging the power of Uniflow on [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Inferentia2 (Inf2) instances](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/) for effectively converting unstructured data into a structured format, ideal for private LLM fine-tuning. We delve into the intricacies of handling sensitive information while maintaining confidentiality and data integrity.  Furthermore, we explore the robust capabilities of the AWS Neuron SDK, which plays a pivotal role in enhancing the performance of your ML models. The Neuron SDK is specifically designed to optimize ML workloads on AWS hardware, ensuring you achieve faster processing speeds and reduced operational costs.\n",
