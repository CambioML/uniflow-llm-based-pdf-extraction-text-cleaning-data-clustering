For class lives, see Revenue Procedure 88-57, 1987-2 C.B. 674. \\nquestion: 1. What types of costs qualify for the routine maintenance safe harbor?\\nAnswer: Costs that meet the five criteria outlined in the text: recurring activities performed on tangible property, raising from the use of the property in a trade or business, keeping the property in an ordinary, efficient operating condition, being reasonably expected at the time of placement in service, and being performed more than once (for buildings and building systems within 10 years or for other property within its class life).\\n\\nQuestion: 2.

This method is an alternative to the calculation, allocation, and substantiation of actual expenses.\\nThe deduction under the optional method is limited to $1,500 per year based on $5 per square foot for up to 300 square feet. Under this method, you claim your allowable mortag interest, real estate taxes, and casually losses on the home as itemized deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040).

If you use your car for both business and personal purposes, you must divide your expenses based on actual mileage. Generally, commuting expenses between your home and your business location, within the area of your tax home, are not deductible.\\nYou can deduct actual car expenses, which include depreciation (or lease payments), gas and oil, fires, repairs, tune-ups, insurance, and registration fees. Or, instead of figuring the business part of these actual expenses, you may be able to use the standard mileage rate to figure your deduction. For 2022, the standard mileage rate is 58.5 cents per mile before July 1, 2022, and 62.5 cents per mile on or after July 1, 2022.

If you have a recovery in a later year, include the recovered amount in income in that year. However, if part of the deduction for the expense did not reduce your tax, you do not have to include that part of the recovered amount in income.\\nFor more information on recoveries and the tax benefit rule, see Pub. 525.\\n**Payments in kind.** If you provide services to pay a business expense, the amount you can deduct is limited to your out-of-pocket costs. You cannot deduct the cost of your own labor.\\nSimilarly, if you pay a business expense in goods or other property, you can deduct only what the property costs you. If these costs are included in the cost of goods sold, do not deduct them again as a business expense.\\n**Limits on losses.** If your deductions for an investment or business activity are more than the income it brings in, you have a loss. There may be limits on how much of the loss you can deduct.\\n**Not-for-profit limits.** If you carry on your business activity without the intention of making a profit, you cannot use a loss from it to offset other income. For more information, see _Not-for-profit Activities_, later.\\n**At-risk limits.** Generally, a deductible loss from a trade or business or other income-producing activity is limited to the investment you have \"at risk\" in the activity. You are at risk in any activity for the following.\\n1. The money and adjusted basis of property you contribute to the activity.\\n2. Amounts you borrow for use in the activity if: 1. You are personally liable for repayment, or 2. You pledge property (other than property used in the activity) as security for the loan.\\nFor more information, see Pub. 925.\\n_Passive activities._ Generally, you are in a passive activity if you have a trade or business activity in which you do not materially participate, or a rental activity. In general, deductions for losses from passive activities only offset income from passive activities. You cannot use any excess deductions to offset other income. In addition, passive activity credits can only offset the tax on net passive income. Any excess loss or credits are carried over to later years. Suspended passive losses are fully deductible in the year you completely dispose of the activity. For more information, see Pub. 925.\\n**Not operating loss (NOL).** If your deductions are more than your income for the year, you may have an NOL.

An accounting method is a set of rules used to determine when and how income and expenses are reported. The two basic methods are the cash method and the accrual method. Whichever method you choose must clearly reflect income.\\nFor more information on accounting methods, see Pub. 538.\\n**Cash method.** Under the cash method of accounting, you generally deduct business expenses in the tax year you pay them.\\n**Accural method.** Under the accrual method of accounting, you generally deduct business expenses when both of the following apply.\\n1. The all-events test has been met. The test is met when: 1. All events have occurred that fix the fact of liability, and 2. The liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy.\\n2. Economic performance has occurred.\\n_Economic performance._ You generally cannot deduct or capitalize a business expense until economic performance occurs. If your expense is for property or services provided to you, or for your use of property, economic performance occurs as the property or services are provided, or the property is used. If your expense is for property or services you provide to others, economic performance occurs as you provide the property or services.\\n_Example._ Your tax year is the calendar year. In December 2022, the Field Plumping Company did some repair work at your place of business and sent you a bill for $600. You paid it by check in January 2023. If you use the accrual method of accounting, deduct the $600 on your tax return for 2022 because all events have occurred to \"fix\" the fact of liability (in this case, the work was completed), the liability can be determined, and economic performance occurred in that year.\\nIf you use the cash method of accounting, deduct the expense on your 2023 tax return.\\n**Prepayment.** You generally cannot deduct expenses in advance, even if you pay them in advance. This applies to prepaid interest, prepaidinsurance premiums, and any other prepaid expense that creates an intranight asset. If you play an amount that creates an intranight asset, then you must capitalize the amounts paid and begin to amortize the payment over the appropriate period.\\nHowever, you do not have to capitalize amounts for creating an intangible asset if the right or benefit created does not extend beyond the earlier of 12 months after the date that you first receive the right or benefit or the end of the tax year following the year in which you made the advance payment. If you are a cash method taxapayer and your advance payment qualifies for this exception, then you can generally deduct the amount when paid. If you are an actual method taxapayer, you cannot deduct the amount until the all-events that has been met and economic performance has occurred.\\n**Example 1**.: In 2022, you sign a 10-year lease and immediately pay your rent for the first 3 years. Even though you paid the rent for 2022, 2023, and 2024, you can only deduct the rent for 2022 on your 2022 tax return. You can deduct the rent for 2023 and 2024 on your tax returns for those years.\\n**Example 2**.: You are a cash method calendar year taxapayer. On December 1, 2022, you sign a 12-month lease, effective beginning January 1, 2023, and immediately pay your rent for the entire 12-month period that begins on January 1, 2023. The right or benefit attributable to the payment neither extends more than 12 months beyond January 1, 2023 (the first day that you are entitled to use the property) nor beyond the tax year ending December 31, 2023 (the year following the year in which you made the advance payment). Therefore, your prepayment does not have to be capitalized, and you can deduct the entire payment in the year you pay it.\\n**Contested liability.** Under the cash method, you can deduct a contested liability only in the year you pay the liability. Under the accual method, you can deduct contested liabilities such as taxes (except foreign or U.S. possession income, war profits, and excess profits taxes) either in the tax year you the liability (or transfer money or other property to satisfy the obligation) or in the tax year you settle the contest. However, to take the deduction in the year of payment or transfer, you must meet certain conditions. See Regulations section 1.461-2.\\n**Related person.** Under the accual method of accounting, you generally deduct expenses when you incur them, even if you have not yet paid them. However, if you and the person you are related and that person uses the cash method of accounting, you must pay the expense before you can deduct it. Your deduction is allowed when the amount is including in income by the related cash method paye. For more information, see _Related Persons_ in Pub. 538.\\nThe benefit gained by making this election is that the IRS will not immediately question whether your activity is engaged in for profit. Accordingly, it will not restrict your deductions. Rather, you will gain time to earn a profit in the required number of years. If you show 3 (or 2) years of profit at the end of this period, your deductions are not limited under these rules. If you do not have 3 (or 2) years of profit, the limit can be applied retroactively to any year with a loss in the 5-year (or 7-year) period.\\nFiling Form 5213 automatically extends the period of limitations on any year in the 5-year (or 7-year) period to 2 years after the due date of the tax return for the last year of the period. The period is extended only for deductions that the activity and any related deductions that might be affected.\\n**Type 1**: _You must file Form 5213 within 3 years after the due date of your tax return (determined without extensions) for the year in which you first carried on the activity, or, if earlier, within 60 days after receiving written notice from the IRS proposing to disallow deductions attributable to the activity._\\n**Cross income**\\nGross income from a not-for-profit activity includes the total of all gains from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property, and all other gross recegies derived from the activity. Gross income from the activity also includes capital gains and rents received for the use of property that is held in connection with the activity.\\nYou can determine gross income from any not-for-profit activity by subtracting the cost of goods sold from your gross recegies. However, if you determine gross income by subtracting cost of goods sold from gross recegies, you must do so consistently, and in a manner that follows generally accepted methods of accounting. \\nquestion: 1.

You can generally deduct the cost of fringe benefits.\\nYou may be able to exclude all or part of the value of some fringe benefits from your employers\\' pay. You also may not use employment taxes on the value of the fringe benefits. See Table 2-1 in Pub. 15-B for details.\\nGenerally, no deduction is allowed for activities generally considered entertainment, amusement, or recreation, or for a facility used in connection with such activity. However, you may deduct these expenses if the goods, services, or facilities are treated as compensation to the recipient and reported on Form W-2 for an employee or on Form 1099-NEC for an independent contract. If the recipient is an officer, director, beneficial owner (directly or indirectly), or other \"specified individual\" (as defined in section 274(e)(2)(B) and Regulations section 1.274-9(b), special rules apply. See section 274(e)(2) and Regulations sections 1.274-9 and 1.274-10.\\nCertain fringe benefits are discussed next. See Pub. 15-B for more details on these and other fringe benefits.\\nMeals and lodging.Generally, you can deduct 50% of certain meal expenses and 100% of certain lodging expenses provided to your employees. If the amounts are deductible, deduct the cost in whatever category the expense falls.\\nDeduction limit on mealsYou can generally deduct only 50% of the cost of furnishing meals to your employees. However, you can deduct the full cost of certain meals; see section 274(n)(2) and Regulations section 1.274-12(c) for more information. For example, you can deduct the full cost of the following meals.\\nMeals whose value you include in an employee\\'s wages.\\nMeals you furnish to your employees as part of the expense of providing recreational or social activities, such as holiday parties or annual prichens, when made primarily for the benefit of your employees other than employees who are officers, shareholders or other owners who own a 10% or greater interest in your business, or other highly compensated employees.\\nMeals you furnish to your employees at the work site when you operate a restaurant or catering service.\\nMeals you/re required by federal law to furnish to crew members of certain commercial vessels (or would be required to furnish if the vessels were operated at sea). This doesn\\'t include such furnish on vessels primarily providing luxury water transportation.\\nMeals you furnish on an oil or gas platform or drilling rig located offshore or in Alaska. This includes meals you furnish at a support cam that is near and integral to an oil or gas drilling rig located in Alaska.\\nP.L. 115-97, Tax Cuts and Jobs Actchanged the rules for the deduction of food or beverage expenses that are excluelable from employee income as a de minimising fringe benefit. For amounts incurred or paid after 2017, the 50% limit on deductions for food or beverage expenses also applies to food or beverage expenses excludeable from employee income as a dub minis fringe benefit. While your business deduction may be limited, the rules that allow you to exclude certain de minimis meals and meals on your business premises from your employee\\'s wages still apply. See Meals in section 2 of Pub. 15-B.\\nFood and beverage expense incurred together with entertainment expensesP.L. 115-97 changed the rules for the deduction of business entertainment expenses. For amounts incurred or paid after 2017, no business deduction is allowed for any item generally considered to be entertainment, amusement, or recreation. As discussed earlier, you can deduct 50% of the cost of business meals. If food and beverages are provided during or at an entertainment activity, and the food and beverages are purchased separately from the entertainment, or the cost of the food and beverages is stated separately from the intent on one or more bills, involos, or recebits, you may continue to deduct 50% of the business meal expenses. The amount charged for food or beverages on a bill, invice, or receipt must reflect the venue\\'s usual selling cost for those items if they were to be purchased separately from the entertainment or must approximate the reasonable value of those items. If you purchase food and beverages together with entertainment expenses and the cost of the food and beverages isn\\'t stated separately on the invice, the cost of the food and beverages is also an entertainment expense and none of the expenses are deductible. For more information, including details about additional requirements that must be met for a business meal to be deductible, see Regulations sections 1.274-11 and 1.274-12(a).\\nThe Section 210 of the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 provides for the temporary allowance of a 100% business meal deduction for food or beverages provided by a restaurant and paid or incurred after December 31, 2020, and before January 1, 2023. For more information, see Notice 2021-25, 2021-17 I.R. 1118, available at IRS.govwith2021-17 IBRNOT:2021-25; and Notice 2021-63, 2021-49 I.R. 835, available at IRS.govwith2021-49 IBRNOT:2021-63.\\nTransportation (commuting) benefitsIf you provide your employees with qualified transportation benefits, such as transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, or qualified parking, you may no longer deduct these amounts. P.L. 115-97 provides that no deduction is allowed for qualified transportation benefits (whether provided directly by you, through a bona fide reimbursement arrangement, or through a compensation reduction agreement) incurred or paid after 2017. Also, no deduction is allowed for any expense incurred for providing any transportation, or any payment or reimbursement to your employee, in connection with travel between your employees\\'s residence and place of employment, except as necessary for ensuring the safety of your employee or for qualified bicycle commuting reimbursments as described in section 132(f)(5) (F). While you may no longer deduct payments for qualified transportation benefits, the fringe benefit exclusion rules still apply and the payments, except for qualified bicycle commuting reimbursments, may be excluded from your employee\\'s wages. Although the value of a qualified transportation fringe benefit is relevant in determining the fringe benefit exclusion and whether the section 274(e)(2) exception for expenses treated as compensation applies, the deduction that is disallowed relates to the expense of providing a qualified transportation fringe, not its value. For more information, see Regulations sections 1.274-13 and 1.274-14. See Pub. 15-B for more information about qualified transportation benefits.\\nEmployee benefit programsEmployee benefit programs include the following.\\nAccident and health plansAction assistanceCafearia plansDependent care assistanceCafeaEducation assistanceCafe insuranceCafe insurance coverageLife insurance coverageYou can\\'t deduct the cost of life insurance coverage for you, an employee, or any person with a financial interest in your business if you drive directly or indirectly the beneficiary of the policy. See Regulations section 1.264-1 for more information.\\nWelfare benefit fundsA welfare benefit fund is a funded plan (or a funded arrangement having the effect of a plan) that provides welfare benefits to your employees, independent contractors, or their beneficiaries. Welfare benefits are any benefits other than deferred compensation or transfers of restricted property.\\nYour deduction for contributions to a welfare benefit fund is limited to the fund\\'s qualified cost for the tax year. If your contributions to the fund are more than its qualified cost, carry the excess over to the next tax year.\\nGenerally, the fund\\'s \"qualified cost\" is the total of the following amounts, reduced by the after-tax income of the fund.\\nThe cost you would\\'ve been able to deduct using the cash method of accounting if you had paid for the benefits directly.\\nThe contributions added to a reserve account that are needed to fund claims incurred but not paid as of the end of the year.\\nThese claims can be for supplemental unemployment benefits, severance pay, or disability, medical, or life insurance benefits.\\nFor more information, see sections 419(c) and 419A and the related regulations.\\nLoans or AdvancesYou can generally deduct as wages an advance you make to an employee for services to be performed if you don\\'t expect the employee to repay the advance. However, if the employee performs no services, treat the amount you advanced as a loan; if the employee doesn\\'t repay the loan, treat it as income to the employee.\\nBelow-market interest rate loansOn certain loans you make to an employee or shareholder, you\\'re treated as having received interest income and as having paid compensation or dividends equal to that interest.

Leveraged leases transactions may not be considered leases. Leveraged leases generally involve three parties: a lease, a lessee, and a lander to the leossor. Usually, the lease term covers a large part of the useful life of the leased property, and the lessee\\'s payments to the leaser are enough to cover the lessors payments to the lender.\\nIf you plan to take part in what appears to be a leveraged lease, you may want to get an advance ruling.\\n* Revenue Procedure 2001-28 contains the guidelines the IRS will use to determine if a leveraged lease is a lease for federal income tax purposes.\\n* Revenue Procedure 2001-29 provides the information required to be furnished in a request for an advance ruling on a leveraged lease transaction.\\nThese two revenue procedures can be found in I.R.B. 2001-19, which is available at _[BS.gov/tab/rs-its/tb01-19.pdf]_.\\nFor advance ruling purposes only, the IRS will consider the leossor in a leveraged lease transaction to be the owner of the property and the transaction to be a valid lease if all the factors in the revenue procedure are met, including the following.\\n* The lesser must maintain a minimum unconditional \"at risk\" equity investment in the property (at least 20% of the cost of the property) during the entire lease term.\\n* The lease may not have a contractual right to buy the property from the lessor at less than FMV when the right is exercised.\\n* The leasege may not invest in the property, except as provided by Revenue Procedure 2001-28.\\n* The lessee may not lend any money to the lesser to buy the property or guarantee the loan used by the leossor to buy the property.\\n* The lesser must show that it expects to receive a profit apart from the tax deductions, allowances, credits, and other tax attributes.\\nThe liability and amount of taxes are determined by state or local law and the lease agreement. Economic performance occurs as you use the property.\\n_Example 1._ Oak Corporation is a calendar year taxplayer that uses an accruval method of accounting. Oak leases land for use in its business. Under state law, owners of real property become liable (incur a len on the property) for real estate taxes for the year on January 1 of that year. However, they don\\'t have to pay these taxes until July 1 of the next year (18 months later) when tax bills are issued. Under the terms of the lease, Oak becomes liable for the real estate taxes in the later year when the tax bills are issued. If the lease ends before the tax bill for a year is issued, Oak isn\\'t liable for the taxes for that year.\\nOak cannot deduct the real estate taxes as rent until the tax bill is issued. This is when Oak\\'s liability under the lease becomes fixed.\\n_Example 2._ The facts are the same as in _Example 1_, except that, according to the terms of the lease, Oak becomes liable for the real estate taxes when the owner of the property becomes liable for them. As a result, Oak will deduct the real estate taxes as rent on its tax return for the earlier year. This is the year in which Oak\\'s liability under the lease becomes fixed. \\nquestion: 1.

Very often when you get an existing lease from another leasesee, you must pay the previous lessee money to get the lease, besides having to pay the rent on the lease.\\nIf you get an existing lease on property or equipment for your business, you must generally amortize any amount you pay to get that lease over the remaining term of the lease. For example, if you pay $10,000 to get a lease and there are 10 years remaining on the lease with no option to renew, you can deduct $1,000 each year.\\nThe cost of getting an existing lease of tangible property is not subject to the amortization rules for section 197 intangibles discussed in chapter 8.\\n**Option to renew.** The term of the lease for amortization includes all renewal options plus any other period for which you and the leossor reasonably expect the lease to be renewed. However, this applies only if less than 75% of the cost of getting the lease is for the term remaining on the purchase date (not including any period for which you may choose to renew, extend, or continue the lease). Allocate the lease cost to the original term and any option term based on the facts and circumstances. In some cases, it may be appropriate to make the allocation using a present value calculation. For more information, see Regulations section 1.178-1(b)(5).\\n**Example 1**.: You paid $10,000 to get a lease with 20 years remaining on it and two options to renew for 5 years each. Of this cost, you paid $7,000 for the original lease and $3,000 for the renewal options. Because $7,000 is less than 75% of the total $10,000 cost of the lease (or $7,500), you must amortize the $10,000 over 30 years. That is the remaining life of your present lease plus the periods for renewal.\\n**Example 2**.: The facts are the same as in _Example 1_, except that you paid $8,000 for the original lease and $2,000 for the renewal options. You can amortize the entire $10,000 over the 20-year remaining life of the original lease. The $8,000 cost of getting the original lease was not less than 75% of the total cost of the lease (or $7,500).\\n**Cost of a modification agreement.** You may have to pay an additional \"rent\" amount over part of the lease period to change certain provisions in your lease. You must capitalize these payments and amortize them over the remaining period of the lease. You can\\'t deduct the payments as additional rent, even if they are described as rent in the agreement.\\n**Example**.: You are a calendar year tax-payer and sign a 20-year lease to rent part of a building starting on January 1. However, before you occupy it, you decide that you really need less space. The lessor agrees to reduce your rent from $7,000 to $6,000 per year and to release the excess space from the original lease. In exchange, you agree to pay an additional rent amount of $3,000, payable in 60 monthly installments of $50 each.\\nYou must capitalize the $3,000 and amortize it over the 20-year term of the lease. Your amortization deduction each year will be $150 ($3,000 + 20). You can\\'t deduct the $600 (12 x $50) that you will pay during each of the first 5 years as rent.\\n**Commissions, bonuses, and fees.** Commissions, bonuses, fees, and other amounts you pay to get a lease on property you use in your business are capital costs. You must amortize these costs over the term of the lease.\\n**Loss on merchandise and fixtures.** If you sell at a loss merchandise and fixtures that you bought solely to get a lease, the loss is a cost of getting the lease. You must capitalize the loss and amortize it over the remaining term of the lease. \\nquestion: 1. What should a business do if they want to obtain an existing lease instead of entering into a new one? \\n2. Is there a specific rule regarding the percentage of the lease cost that must be paid upfront for the original term versus renewal options? \\n3. How long does the term of the lease include for amortization purposes, considering renewal options? \\n4. Can the allocation between the original term and renewal options be made using a different method apart from present value calculation? \\n5. What happens if more than 75% of the cost of getting a lease is for the renewal options rather than the original term? \\n6. Are there any exceptions to the general rule of amortizing the cost of getting a lease over its remaining term? \\n7. Does the cost of modifications to a lease fall under the category of rent or capitalized costs? \\n8. Must commissions, bonuses, and fees paid to acquire a lease also be capitalized and amortized? \\n9. What should be done if merchandise and fixtures used to secure a lease are sold at a loss? \\n10. Do the examples provided illustrate specific scenarios where the cost of getting a lease would be treated differently depending on the proportion of initial payment vs. renewal options? \\n11. Under what conditions might it be necessary to consult regulations such as Section 1.178-1(b)(5)? \\n12. Could the tax implications differ significantly between obtaining a new lease and acquiring an existing one? \\n13. Would the tax treatment vary depending on whether the lease pertains to real estate or personal property? \\n14. Are there any potential pitfalls businesses should avoid while calculating the cost of getting a lease for tax purposes? \\n15.

Depreciate the property over its appropriate recovery period. You can't amortize the cost over the remaining term of the lease.\\nIf you don't keep the improvements when you end the lease, figure your gain or loss based on your adjusted basis in the improvements at that time.\\nFor more information, see the discussion of MACRS in chapter 4 of Pub. 946.\\n**Assignment of a lease.** If a long-term leasee who makes permanent improvements to land later assigns all lease rights to you for money and you pay the rent required by the lease, the amount you pay for the assignment is a capital investment. If the rental value of the leased land increased since the lease began, part of your capital investment is for that increase in the rental value. The rest is for your investment in the permanent improvements.\\nThe part that is for the increased rental value of the land is a cost of getting a lease, and you amortize it over the remaining term of the lease.

If you use the proceeds of a loan for more than one type of expense, you must allocate the interest based on the use of the loan\\'s proceeds.\\nAllocate your interest expense to the following categories.\\nNompassive trade or business activity interest.\\nPassive trade or business activity interest.\\nInvestment interest.\\nPortfolio interest.\\nPersonal interest.\\nIn general, you allocate interest on a loan the same way you allocate the loan proceeds. You allocate loan proceeds by tracing disbursments to specific uses.\\nThe easiest way to trace disbursements to specific uses is to keep the proceeds of a particular loan separate from any other funds.\\nSecured loan.The allocation of loan proceeds and the related interest is generally not affected by the use of property that secures the loan.\\nMarge and Jeff secure a loan with property used in their business. They use the loan proceeds to buy an automobile for personal use. Jeff and Margo must allocate interest expense on the loan to personal use (purchase of the automobile) even though the loan is secured by business property.\\nP.L. 115-97, section 11043, limited the deduction for mortgage interest paid on home equity loans and line of credit. For more information, see Pub. 936.\\nAllocation period.The period for which a loan is allocated to a particular use begins on the date the proceeds are used and ends on the earlier of the following dates.\\nThe date the loan is repaid.\\nThe date the loan is reallocated to another use.\\nProceeds not disbursed to borrower.Even if the leader disburses the loan proceeds to a third party, the allocation of the loan is still based on your use of the funds. This applies whether you pay for property, services, or anything else by invorning a loan, or you take property subject to a debt.\\nProceeds deposited in borrower\\'s account.Treat loan proceeds deposited in an account as property held for investment. It does not matter whether the account pays interest. Any interest you pay on the loan is investment interest expense. If you withdraw the proceeds of the loan, you must reallocate the loan based on the use of the funds.\\nCelina, a calendar-year taxplayer, borrows $100,000 on January 4 and immediately uses the proceeds to open a checking account. No other amounts are deposited in the account during the year and no part of the loan principal is repaid during the year. On April 2, Celina uses $20,000 from the checking account for a passive activity expenditure. On September 4, Celina uses an additional $40,000 from the account for personal purposes.\\nUnder the interest allocation rules, the entire $100,000 loan is treated as property held for investment for the period from January 4 through April 1. From April 2 through September 3, Celina must treat $20,000 of the loan as used in the passive activity and $80,000 of the loan as property held for investment. From September 4 through December 31, the must treat $40,000 of the loan as used for personal purposes, $20,000 as used in the passive activity, and $40,000 as property held for investment.\\nOrder of funds spent.Generally, you treat loan proceeds deposited in an account as used (spend) before either of the following amounts.\\nAny unborrowed amounts held in the same account.\\nAny amounts deposited after these loan proceeds.\\nExample.On January 9, 9, 9 and 9 are the only one-to-you withdrew it until you either repay it or real-cate it to another use is personal interest expense. The interest charged on the loan proceeds you left in the account (S867) continues to be investment interest expense until you either repay it or real-cate it to another use.\\n**Loan repayment.** When you repay any part of a loan allocated to more than one use, treat it as being prepaid in the following order.\\n1. Personal use.\\n2. Investments and passive activities (other than those included in (3)).\\n3. Passive activities in connection with a rental real estate activity in which you actively participate.\\n4. Former passive activities.\\n5. Trade or business use and expenses for certain low-income housing projects.\\n**Line of credit (continuous borrowings).** The following rules apply if you have a line of credit or similar arrangement.\\n1. Treat all borrowed funds on which interest accrues at the same fixed or variable rate as a single loan.\\n2. Treat borrowed funds or parts of borrowed funds on which interest accrues at different fixed or variable rates as different loans. Treat these loans as repaid in the order shown on the loan agreement.\\n**Loan refinancing.** Allocate the replacement loan to the same uses to which the repaid loan was allocated. Make this allocation only to the extent you use the proceeds of the new loan to repay any part of the original loan.\\n**Debt-financed distribution.** A debt-financed distribution occurs when a partnership or S corporation borrows funds and allocates those funds to distributions made to partners or shareholders. The manner in which you report the interest expense associated with the distributed debt proceeds depends on your use of those proceeds.\\n_How to report._ If the proceeds were used in a nonpassive trade or business activity, report the interest on Schedule E (Form 1040), one 28; enter \"interest expense\" and the name of the partnership or S corporation in column (a) and the amount in column (i). If the proceeds were used in a passive activity, follow the instructions for Form 8582 to determine the amount of interest expense that can be reported on Schedule E (Form 1040), line 28; enter \"interest expense\" and the name of the partnership in column (a) and the amount in column (g). If the proceeds were used in an investment activity, enter the interest on Form 4952. If the proceeds are used for personal purposes, the interest is generally not deductible.\\nIf you receive a refund of interest you over-paid in an earlier year, this amount will be reported in how 44 of Form 1098. You cannot deduct this amount. For information on how to report this refund, see _Refunds.of interest_, later, in this chapter.\\n_Expenses paid to obtain a mortgage._ Certain expenses you pay to obtain a mortgage cannot be deducted as interest. These expenses, which include mortgage commissions, abstract fees, and recording fees, are capital expenses. If the property mortgaged is business or income-producing property, you can amortize the costs over the life of the mortgage.\\n_Prepayment penalty._ If you pay off your mortgage early and pay the lender a penalty for doing this, you can deduct the penalty as interest.\\n**Interest on employment tax deficiency.** Interest charged on employment taxes assessed on your business is deductible.\\n**Original issue discount (OID).** OID is a form of interest. A loan (mortgage or other debt) generally has OID when its proceeds are less than its principal amount. The OID is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of the loan.\\nA loan\\'s stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of all amounts (principal and interest) payable on it other than qualified stated interest. Qualified stated interest is standardised that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than another loan of the issuser) at least annually over the term of the loan at a single fixed rate.\\nYou generally deduct OID over the term of the loan. Figure the amount to deduct each year using the constant-yield method, unless the OID on the loan is de minimis.\\n_De minimis OID._ The OID is de minimis if it is less than one-fourth of 1% (0.0025) of the stated redemption price of the loan at maturity multiplied by the number of full years from the date of original issue to maturity (the term of the loan).\\nIf the OID is de minimis, you can choose one of the following ways to figure the amount you can deduct each year.\\n* On a constant-yield basis over the term of the loan.\\n* On a straight-line basis over the term of the loan.\\n* In proportion to stated interest payments.\\n* In its entirety at maturity of the loan.\\nYou make this choice by deducting the OID in a manner consistent with the method chosen on your timely filed tax return for the tax year in which the loan is issued.\\n_Example._ On January 1, 2022, you took out a $100,000 discounted loan and received $98,500 in proceeds. The loan will mature on January 1, 2032 (a 10-year term), and the $100,000 principal is payable on that date. Interest of $10,000 is payable on January 1 of each year, beginning January 1, 2023. The $1,500 OID on the loan is de minimis because it is less than $2,500 ($100,000 \\\\(\\\\times\\\\) 0.0025 \\\\(\\\\times\\\\) 10). You choose to deduct the OID on a straight-linebasis over the term of the loan. Beginning in 2022, you can deduct $150 each year for 10 years.\\n_Constant-yield method._ If the OID is not de minimis, you must use the constant-yield method to figure how much you can deduct each year. You figure your deduction for the first year using the following steps.\\n1. Determine the issue price of the loan. Generally, this equals the proceeds of the loan. If you paid points on the loan (as discussed later), the issue price is generally the difference between the proceeds and the points.\\n2. Multiply the result in (1) by the yield to maturity.\\n3. Subtract any qualified stated interest payments from the result in (2). This is the OID you can deduct in the first year.\\nTo figure your deduction in any subsequent year, follow the steps above, except determine the adjusted issue price in step 1. To get the adjusted issue price, add to the issue price any OID previously deducted. Then follow steps 2 and 3 above.\\nThe yield to maturity is generally shown in the literature you receive from your lender. If you do not have this information, consult your tender or tax advisor. In general, the yield to maturity is the discount rate that, when used in figuring the present value of all principal and interest payments, produces an amount equal to the principal amount of the loan.\\n_Example._ The facts are the same as in the previous example, except that you deduct the OID on a constant-yield basis over the term of the loan. The yield to maturity on your loan is 10.2467%, compound annually.

Designated property is any of the following.\\n* Real property.\\n* Tangible personal property with a class life of 20 years or more.\\n* Tangible personal property with an estimated production period of more than 2 years.\\n* Tangible personal property with an estimated production period of more than 1 year if the estimated cost of production is more than 8T million.\\n**Property you produce.** You produce property if you construct, build, install, manufacture, develop, improve, create, raise, or grow it. Treat property produced for you under a contract as produced by you up to the amount you pay or incur for the property.\\n**Carrying charges.** Carrying charges include taxes you pay to carry or develop real estate or to carry, transport, or install personal property. You can choose to capitalize carrying charges not subject to the uniform capitalization rules if they are otherwise deductible. For more information, see _matter_.\\n**Capitalized interest:** Treat capitalized interest as a cost of the property produced. You recover your interest when you sell or use the property. If the property is inventory, recover capitalized interest through cost of goods sold. If the property is used in your trade or business, recover capitalized interest through an adjustment to basis, depreciation, amortization, or other method.\\n**Partnerships and S corporations.** The interest capitalization rules are applied first at the partnership or S corporation level. The rules are then applied at the partners or shareholders\\' level to the extent the partnership or S corporation has insufficient debt to support the production or construction costs.\\nIf you are a partner or a shareholder, you may have to capitalize interest you incur during the tax year for the production costs of the partnership or S corporation. You may also have to capitalize interest incurred by the partnership or S corporation for your own production costs.

You cannot deduct a promissory note you gave as payment because it is a promise to pay and not an actual payment.\\n**Prepaid interest.** You generally cannot deduct any interest paid before the year it is due. Interest paid in advance can be deducted only in the tax year in which it is due.\\n**Discounted loan.** If interest or a discount is subtracted from your loan proceeds, it is not a payment of interest and you cannot deduct it when you get the loan. For more information, see _Original issue discount (OID)_ under _Interest Expense Limitation_.\\n**Response interest.** For any period, forgoin Interest is:\\n1. The interest that would be payable for that period if interest accrued on the loan at the AFB and was payable annually on December 31, minus\\n2. Any interest actually payable on the loan for the period.\\nlender and borrower total $100,000 or less. If the borrowers\\' net investment income is $1,000 or less, it is treated as zero. This limit does not apply to a loan if the avoidance of any federal tax is one of the main purposes of the interest arrangement.\\nTreatment of term loans.If you receive a below-market term loan other than a gift or demand loan, you are treated as receiving an additional cash payment (as a dividend, etc.) on the date the loan is made. This payment is equal to the loan amount minus the present value, at the AFR, of all payments due under the loan. The same amount is treated as OID on the loan. See _Original issue discount (OID) under Interest You Can Deduct_, earlier.\\nExceptions for loans of $10,000 or less.The rules for below-market loans do not apply to any day on which the total outstanding loans between the borrower and lender is $10,000 or less. This exception applies only to the following.\\n1. Gift loans between individuals if the loan is not directly used to buy or carry income-producing assets.\\n2. Compensation-related loans or corporation-shareholder loans if the avoidance of any federal tax is not a principal purpose of the interest arrangement.\\nThis exception does not apply to a term loan described in (2) above that was previously subject to the below-market loan rules. Those rules will continue to apply even if the outstanding balance is reduced to $10,000 or less.\\nExceptions for loans without significant tax effect.The following loans are specifically explored from the rules for below-market loans because their interest arrangements do not have a significant effect on the federal tax liability of the borrower or the lender.\\n1. Loans made available by lenders to the general public on the same terms and conditions that are consistent with the lender\\'s customary business practices.\\n2. Loans subsidized by a federal, state, or municipal government that are made available under a program of general application to the public.\\n3. Certain employee-relocation loans.\\n4. Certain loans to or from a foreign person, unless the interest income would be effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business and not exempt from U.S. tax under an income tax treaty.\\n5. Any other loan if the taxayer can show that the interest arrangement has no significant effect on the federal tax liability of the lender or the borrower. Whether an interest arrangement has a significant effect on the federal tax liability of the lender or the borrower will be determined by all the facts and circumstances. Consider all the following factors.\\n1. Whether items of income and deduction generated by the loan offset each other.\\n2. The amount of the items.\\n3. The cost of complying with the below-market loan provisions if they were to apply.\\n4. Any reasons, other than taxes, for structuring the transaction as a below-market loan.\\nException for loans to qualified continuing care facilities.The below-market interest rules do not apply to a loan owed by a qualified continuing care facility under a continuing care contract if the lender or lenders\\'s exposure is age 62 or older by the end of the calendar year.\\nA qualified continuing care facility is one or more facilities (excluding nursing homes) meeting the requirements listed below.\\n1.

The taxing authority must base the taxes on the assessed value of the real estate and charge them uniformly against all property under its jurisdiction. Decoitube real estate taxes generally do not include taxes charged for local benefits and improvements that increase the value of the property.

See _Form 3115_, later.\\n_Making the election._ If you elect to ratably accreule the taxes for the first year in which you incur real estate taxes, attach a statement to your income tax return for that year. The statement should show all the following items.\\n* The trades or businesses to which the election applies and the accounting method or methods used.\\n* The period to which the taxes relate.\\n* The calculation of the real estate tax deduction for that first year.\\nGenerally, you must file your return by the due date (including extensions). However, if you timely filed your return for the year without electing to ratably accreule, you can still make the election by filing an amended return within 6 months after the due date of the return (excluding extensions). Atch the statement to the amended return and write \"Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-2\" on the statement.

Self-insurance reserve funds. You can't deduct premiums for insurance amounts credited to a reserve set up for self-insurance. This applies even if you can't get business insurance coverage for certain business risks. However, your actual losses may be deductible. See Pub. 547.\\n2. Loss of earnings. You can't deduct premiums for a policy that pays for lost earnings due to sickness or disability. However, the discussion on overhead insurance, item (8), under _Deductible Premiums_, earlier.\\n3. Certain life insurance and annuities.\\n4. For contracts issued before June 9, 1997, you can't deduct the premiums on a life insurance policy covering you, an employee, or any person with a financial interest in your business if you are directly or indirectly a beneficiary of the policy. You are included among possible beneficiaries of the policy if the policy owner is obligated to repay a loan from you using the proceeds of the policy. A person has a financial interest in your business if the person is an owner or part owner of the business or has lent money to the business.\\n5. For contracts issued after June 8, 1997, you generally can't deduct the premiums on any life insurance policy, endowment contract, or annuity contract if you are directly or indirectly a beneficiary. The disallowance applies without regard to whom the policy covers.\\n6. Performers. If, as a partner in a partnership, you take out an insurance policy on your own life and name your partners as beneficiaries to induce them to retain their investments in the partnership, you are considered a beneficiary. You can't deduct the insurance premiums in the tax year you actually paid them, even if you incurred them in an earlier year. However, see _Pregayment_, later.\\nAccrual method.If you use an accrual method of accounting, you can't deduct insurance premiums before the tax year in which you incur a liability for them. In addition, you can't deduct insurance premiums before the tax year in which you actually pay them (unless the exception for requiring terms applies). For more information about the accrual method of accounting, see _Chapter 1_. For information about the exception for recurring items, see Pub. 538.\\nPrepayment.You can't deduct expenses in advance, even if you pay them in advance. This rule applies to any expense paid for enough in advance to, in effect, create an asset with a useful life extending substantially beyond the end of the current tax year.\\nExpenses such as insurance are generally allocable to a period of time. You can deduct insurance expenses for the year to which they are allocable.\\nExample.In 2022, you signed a 3-year insurance contract. Even though you paid the premiums for 2022, 2023, and 2024 when you signed the contract, you can only deduct the premium for 2022 on your 2022 tax return. You can deduct in 2023 and 2024 the premiums allocable to those years.\\nDividends received.If you receive dividends from business insurance and you deducted the premiums in prior years, at least part of the dividends are generally income. For more information, see _Recovery of amount deducted tax benefit table_ in chapter_1 under flow. Much Can1Docket_. \\nquestion: \\n1.

You can deduct only costs for drilling or preparing a well for the production of oil, gas, or geothermal steam or hot water.\\nYou can elect to deduct only the costs of items with no salvage value. These include wages, fuel, repairs, hailing, and supplies related to drilling wells and preparing them for production. Your cost for any drilling or development work done by contractors under any form of contract is also an IDC. However, see _Amounts paid to contractor that must be capitalized_.\\nYou can also elect to deduct the cost of drilling exploratory bore holes to determine the location and delineation of offshore hydrocarbon deposits if the shaft is capable of conducting hydrocarbons to the surface on completion. It does not matter whether there is any intent to produce hydrocarbons.\\nIf you do not elect to deduct your IDCs as a current business expense, you can elect to deduct them over the 60-month period beginning with the month they were paid or incurred.\\n**Amounts paid to contractor that must be capitalized.** Amounts paid to a contractor must be capitalized if they are either:\\n* Amounts properly allocable to the cost of appreciable property, or\\n* Amounts paid only out of production or proceeds from production if these amounts are depletable income to the recipient.\\n**How to make the election.** You elect to deduct IDCs as a current business expense by taking the deduction on your income tax return for the first tax year you have eligible costs. No formal statement is required. If you file Schedule C (Form 1040), enter these costs under \"Other expenses.\"\\nFor oil and gas wells, your election is binding for the year it is made and for all later years.

See the instructions for Form 3468 for more information.\\n**Nonproductive well.** If you capitalize your IDCs, you have another option if the well is nonproductive. You can deduct the IDCs of the nonproductive well as an ordinary loss. You must indicate and clearly state your election on your tax return for the year the well is completed. Once made, the election for oil and gas wells is binding for all later years.

You recover these costs through depletion as the mineral is removed from the ground. However, you can elect to deduct domestic exploration costs paid or incurred before the beginning of the development stage of the mine (except those for oil and gas wells).\\n**How to make the election.** You elect to deduct exploration costs by taking the deduction on your income tax return, or on an amended income tax return, for the first tax year for which you wish to deduct the costs paid or incurred during the tax year. Your return must adequately describe and identify each property or mine, and clearly state how much is being deducted for each one. The election applies to the tax year you make this election and all later tax years.\\n**Our findings and S corporations.** Each partner, not the partnership, elects whether to taking the deduction on your income tax return for the first tax year you have eligible costs. No formal statement is required. If you file Schedule C (Form 1040), enter these costs under \"Other expenses.\"\\nFor oil and gas wells, your election is binding for the year it is made and for all later years. For geothermal wells, your election can be revoked by the filing of an amended return on which you do not take the deduction. You can file the amended return for the year up to the normal time of expiration for filing a claim for credit or refund, generally, within 3 years after the date you filed the original return or within 2 years after the date you paid the tax, whichever is later.\\n**Energy credit for costs of geothermal wells.** If you capitalize the drilling and development costs of geothermal wells that you place in service during the tax year, you may be able to claim a business energy credit. See the instructions for Form 3468 for more information.\\n**Nonproductive well.** If you capitalize your IDCs, you have another option if the well is nonproductive. You can deduct the IDCs of the nonproductive well as an ordinary loss. You must indicate and clearly state your election on your tax return for the year the well is completed. Once made, the election for oil and gas wells is binding for all later years. You can re-voke your election for a geothermal well by filing an amended return that does not claim the loss.\\n**Costs incurred outside the United States.** You cannot deduct as a current business expense all the IDCs paid or incurred for an oil, gas, or geothermal well located outside the United States. However, you can elect to include the costs in the adjusted basis of the well to figure depletion or depreciation. If you do not make this election, you can deduct the costs over the 10-year period beginning with the tax year in which you paid or incurred them. These rules do not apply to a nonproductive well.\\nUnder these circumstances, you generally treat as ordinary income all of your gain if it is less than your adjusted exploration costs with respect to the mine. If your gain is more than your adjusted exploration costs, treat as ordinary income only a part of your gain, up to the amount of your adjusted exploration costs.\\n**Foreign exploration costs.** If you pay or incur exploration costs for a mine or other natural deposit located outside the United States, you cannot deduct all the costs in the current year. You can elector include the costs (other than for an oil, gas, or geothermal well) in the adjusted basis of the mineral property to figure cost depletion. (Cost depletion is discussed in chapter.B) If you do not make this election, you must deduct the costs over the 10-year period beginning with the tax year in which you pay or incur them. These rules also apply to foreign development costs. \\nquestion: 1. What type of costs are considered exploration costs according to the given text?\\n2.

Once made, the election is binding for the year and cannot be revoked for any reason.\\n**How to make the election.** The election to deduct development costs stably as the ones or minerals are sold must be made for each mine or other natural deposit by a clear indication on your return or by a statement filed with the IRS office where you file your return. Generally, you must make the election by the due date of the return (including extensions).

However, you can elect to deduct the costs of making a facility or public transportation vehicle more accessible to and usable by those who are disabled or elderly. You must own or lease the facility or vehicle for use in connection with your trade or business.\\nA facility is all or any part of buildings, structures, equipment, roads, walks, parking lots, or similar real or personal property. A public transportation vehicle is a vehicle, such as a bus or railroad car, that provides transportation service to the public (including service for your customers, even if you are not in the business of providing transportation services).\\nYou cannot deduct any costs that you paid or incurred to completely renovate or build a facility or public transportation vehicle or to replace appreciable property in the normal course of business.\\n**Deduction limit.** The most you can deduct as a cost of removing barriers to the disabled and the elderly for any tax year is $15,000. However, you can add any costs over this limit to the basis of the property and depreciate these excess costs.\\n**Partners and partnerships.** The $15,000 limit applies to a partnership and also to each partner in the partnership. A partner can allocate the $15,000 limit in any manner among the partners's individually incurred costs and the partner's distributive share of partnership costs. If the partner cannot deduct the entire share of partnership costs, the partnership can add any costs not deducted to the basis of the improved property.\\nA partnership must be able to show that any amount added to basis was not deducted by the partner and that it was over a partner's $15,000 limit (as determined by the partner). If the partnership cannot show this, it is presumed that the partner was able to deduct the distributivity share of the partnership's costs in full.\\n**Example.** Emilio Azui's distributive share of ABC partnerships deductible expenses for the removal of architectural barriers was $14,000. Emilio had $12,000 of similar expenses in his sole propriatorship. He elected to deduct $7,000 of them. Emilio allocated the remaining $8,000 of the $15,000 limit to his share of ABC's expenses. Emilio can add the excess $5,000 of his own expenses to the basis of the property used in his business. Also, if ABC can show that Emilio could not deduct $6,000 ($14,000 - $8,000) of his share of the partnership's expenses because of how Emilio applied the limit, ABC can add $6,000 to the basis of its property.\\n**Qualification standards.** You can deduct your costs as a current expense only if the barrier removal meets the guidelines and requirements issued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990.

See _Research and Experimental Costs_, later.\\n**Purchasing an active trade or business.** Amortizable startup costs for purchasing an active trade or business include only investigative costs incurred in the course of a general search for or preliminary investigation of the business. These are costs that help you decide whether to purchase a business. Costs you incur in an attempt to purchase a specific business are capital expenses that you can\\'t amortize.\\n_Example._ On June 1, you hired an accounting firm and a law firm to assist you in the potential purchase of XYZ, Inc. They researched XYZ\\'s industry and analyzed the financial projections of XYZ, Inc. In September, the law firm prepared and submitted a letter of intent to XYZ, Inc. The letter stated that a binding commitment would result only after a purchase agreement was signed. The law firm and accounting firm continued to provide services, including a review of XYZ\\'s books and records and the preparation of a purchase agreement. On October 22, you signed a purchase agreement with XYZ, Inc.\\nAll amounts paid or incurred to investigate the business before October 22 are amortizable in investigative costs. Amounts paid on or after that date relate to the attempt to purchase the business and therefore must be capitalized.\\n**Disposition of business.** If you completely dispose of your business before the end of the amortization period, you can deduct any remaining deferred startup costs. However, you can deduct these deferred startup costs only to the extent they qualify as a loss from a business. \\nquestion: 1. What document should be attached to timely filed returns to make the election to treat repairs and maintenance as capital expenditures?\\n2. Can all types of startup costs be amortized? Please explain which ones meet the qualification tests.\\n3. Are there any types of costs that cannot be considered startup costs and thus not eligible for amortization?\\n4. What happens if a startup cost does not meet both of the qualification tests mentioned in the text? Is it still deductible?\\n5. Can salaries and wages for employees undergo amortization as part of startup costs? What about their trainers or instructors?\\n6. How do travel and other necessary costs for securing prospective distributors, suppliers, or customers qualify as startup costs?\\n7. Which professional services related to the purchase of a business are considered amortizable investigative costs?\\n8. When does the amortization period begin for a newly acquired business?\\n9. What occurs if a business is sold before the end of the amortization period? Can the remaining deferred startup costs be claimed as a loss?\\n10. Do taxes and interest count towards startup costs? Why or why not?\\n11. Can advertising costs be included in the definition of startup costs according to this text?\\n12. Does the analysis or survey of potential markets, products, labor supply, transportation facilities, etc., always qualify as a startup cost? Under what conditions might it fail to qualify?\\n13. Could the example provided in the text change depending on different facts or circumstances? Explain how.\\n14. Suppose a company hires multiple consulting firms during its initial stages. Would each consultant\\'s fee be treated differently regarding amortization?\\n15. If a company decides against buying a particular business, but has already spent significant resources on investigating it, how will such costs be handled?\\n16. What is the difference between investigative costs and costs relating to attempting to purchase a specific business? Provide examples.\\n17. Can the amortization period be extended beyond the standard timeframe mentioned in the text? If so, under what conditions?\\n18. What impact does inflation have on the amortization process described here?\\n19. How does the treatment of startup costs differ when dealing with intangible assets versus tangible property?\\n20.

You can file the revised statement with a return filed after the return on which you elected to amortize your startup costs.\\n**Organizational costs election statement.** If you elect to amortize your corporation's or partnerships organizational costs, attach a separate statement (if required) that contains the following information.\\n* A description of each cost.\\n* The amount of each cost.\\n* The date each cost was incurred.\\n* The month your corporation or partnership began active business (or acquired the business).\\n* The number of months in your amortization period (which is generally 180 months).\\nWe can also consider the situation of the tax year, but it is not a cash basis.\\nIf you pay or incur an amount that increases the basis of an amortizable section 197 intangible after the 15-year period begins, amortize it over the remainder of the 15-year period beginning with the month the basis increase occurs.\\nYou aren't allowed any other depreciation or amortization deduction for an amortizable section 197 intangible.\\n**Tax-exempt use property subject to a lease.** The amortization period for any section 197 intangible leased under a lease agreement entered into after March 12, 2004, to a tax-exempt organization, governmental unit, or foreign person or entity (other than a partnership), shall not be less than 125% of the lease term.\\n**Cost attributable to other property.** The rules for section 197 intangibles dont apply to any amount that is included in determining the cost of property that isn't a section 197 intangible. For example, if the cost of computer software isn't separately stated from the cost of hardware or other tangible property and you consistently treat it as part of the cost of the hardware or other tangible property, these rules don't apply. Similarly, none of the cost of acquiring real property held for the production of rental income is considered the cost of good-will, going concern value, or any other section 197 intangible. \\nquestion: 1.

Any item similar to items 3 through 7.\\n9. A license, permit, or other right granted by a governmental unit or agency (including issuances and renewals).\\n10. A covenant not to compete entered into in connection with the acquisition of an interest in a trade or business.\\n11. Any franchise, trademark, or trade name.\\n12. A contract for the use of, or a term interest in, any item in this list.\\n_You can\\'t amortize any of the intangibles listed in items 1 through 8 that you created rather than acquired unless you created them in acquiring assets that make up a trade or business or a substantial part of a trade or business._\\n**Goodwill.** This is the value of a trade or business based on expected continued customer patronage due to its name, reputation, or any other factor.\\n**Going concern value.** This is the additional value of a trade or business that attaches to property because the property is an integral part of an ongoing business activity. It includes value based on the ability of a business to continue to function and generate income even though there is a change in ownership (but doesn\\'t include any other section 197 intangible). It also includes value based on the immediate use or availability of an acquired trade or business, such as the use of earnings during any period in which the business wouldn\\'t otherwise be available or operational.\\n**Workforce in place, etc.** This includes the composition of a workforce (for example, its experience, education, or training). It also includes the terms and conditions of employment, whether contractual or otherwise, and any other value placed on employees or any of their attributes.\\nFor example, you must amortize the part of the purchase price of a business that is for the existence of a highly skilled workforce.

The amount you pay or incur for supplier-based intangibles includes, for example, any portion of the purchase price of an acquired trade or business that is attributable to the existence of a favorable relationship with persons providing distribution services (such as a favorable shelf of display space or a retail outlet), or the existence of favorable supply contracts. Don\\'t include any amount required to be paid for the goods or services to honor the terms of the agreement or other relationship. Also, see _Asses That Acer1 Section 197 Intangibles_, later.\\n**Government-granted license, permit, etc.** This is any right granted by a governmental unit or an agency or instrumentality of a governmential unit.

An interest in a trade or business includes an interest in a partnership or aporation engaged in a trade or business.\\nAn interest under either of the following.\\n1. An existing lease or sublease of tangible property.\\n2. A debt that was in existence when the interest was acquired.\\n3. A right to service residential mortgages unless the right is acquired in connection with the acquisition of a trade or business or a substantial part of a trade or business.\\n1. Certain transaction costs incurred by parties to a corporate organization or reorganization in which any part of a gain or loss isnt recognized.\\nIntangible property that isn\\'t amorizable under the rules for section 197 intangibles can be depreciated if it meets certain requirements. You must generally use the straight line method over its useful life. For certain intangibles, the depreciation period is specified in the law and regulations.

If multiple section 197 intangibles are exposed of in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, treat all of the section 197 intangibles as if they were a single asset for purposes of determining the amount of gain that is ordinary income. Any remaining gain, or any loss, is a section 1231 gain or loss. If you held the intangible 1 year or less, any gain or loss on its disposition is an ordinary gain or loss.

There is no limit on the amount of your amortization deduction for reforestation costs paid or incurred during the tax year.\\nThe election to amortize reforestation costs incurred by a partnership, S Corporation, or estimate must be made by the partnership, copporation, or estate. A partner, shareholder, or beneficiary can\\'t make that election.\\nA partner\\'s or shareholder\\'s share of amorizable costs is figured under the general rules for allocating items of income, loss, deduction, etc., of a partnership or S Corporation. The amorizable costs of an estate are divided between the estate and the income beneficiary based on the income of the estate allocable to each.\\nQualifying costs.Reforestation costs are the direct costs of planting or seeding for forestation or reforestation. Qualifying costs include only those costs you must capitalize and include in the adjusted basis of the property. They include costs for the following items.\\n* Site preparation.\\n* Seeds or seedlings.\\n* Labor.\\n* Tools.\\n* Depreciation on equipment used in planting and seeding.\\nQualifying costs don\\'t include costs for which the government reimburses you under a cost-sharing program, unless you include the reimbursement in your income.\\nQualified timber property.Qualified timber property property is property that contains trees in significant commercial quantities. It can be a woodoid or other site but you own or lease. The property qualifies only if it meets all of the following requirements.\\n* Its located in the United States.\\n* It is held for the growing and cutting of timber you will use in, or self for use in, the commercial production of timber products.\\n* It consists of at least one arc planted with tree seedlings in the manner normally used in forestation or reforestation.\\nQualified timber property doesn\\'t include property on which you have planted shelter belts or ornamental trees, such as Christmas trees.\\nAmortization period.The 84-month amortization period starts on the first day of the first month of the second half of the tax year you incur the costs (July 1 for a calendar year tax-paper), regardless of the month you actually incur the costs. You can claim amortization deductions for no more than 6 months of the first and last (github) tax years of the period.\\nLife tenant and remainderan.If one person holds the property for life with the remainder going to another person, the life tenant is entitled to the full amortization for qualifying reforestation costs incurred by the life tenant. Any remainder interest in the property is ignored for amortization purposes.\\nRecapure.If you dispose of qualified timber property within 10 years after the tax year you incur qualifying reforestation expenses, report any gain as ordinary income up to the amortization you took. See chapter 3 of Pub. 544 for more information.\\nHow to make the election.To elect to amortize qualifying reforestation costs, complete Part VI of Form 4562 and attach a statement that contains the following information.\\n* A description of the costs and the dates you incur incurred them.\\n* A description of the type of timber being grown and the purpose for which it is grown.\\nAttach a separate statement for each property for which you amortize rotorestation costs.\\nGenerally, you must make the election on a timely filed return (including extensions) for the tax year in which you incurred the costs. However, if you timely filed your return for the year without making the election, you can still make the election by filing an amended return within 6 months of the due date of the return (excluding extensions). Attach Form 4562 and the statement to the amended return and write \"Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-2\" on Form 4562. File the amended return at the same address you filed the original return.\\nRevoking the election.You must get IRS approval to revoke your election to amortize qualifying reforestation costs. Your application to revoke the election must include your name, address, the years for which your election was in effect, and your reason for revoking it. Provided your daytime telephone number (optional), in case we need to contact you. You, or your duty authorized representative, must sign the application and file it at least 90 days before the due date (without extensions) for filing your income tax return for the first tax year for which your election is to end.\\nThe facility must not significantly increase the output or capacity, extend the useful life, or reduce the total operating costs of the plant or other property. Also, it must not significantly change the nature of the manufacturing or production process or facility.\\nThe federal certifying authority won\\'t certify your property to the extent it appears you will recover (over the property\\'s useful life) all or part of its cost from the profit based on its operation (such as through sales of recovered wastes). The federal certifying authority will describe the nature of the potential cost recovery. You must then reduce the amortizable basis of the facility by this potential recovery.\\nNew identifiable treatment facility.A new identifiable treatment facility is tangible de-preciable property that is identifiable as a treatment facility. It doesn\\'t include a building and its structural components unless the building is exclusively a treatment facility.\\nAtmospheric pollution control facilities.Certain atmospheric pollution control facilities can be amortized over 84 months. To qualify, the following must apply.\\n* The facility must be acquired and placed in service after April 11, 2005. If acquired, the original use must begin with you after April 11, 2005.\\n* The facility must be used in connection with an electric generation plant or other property placed in operation after December 31, 1975, that is primarily coal fired.\\n* If you construct, reconstruct, or erect the facility, only the basis attributable to the construction, reconstruction, or excretion completed after April 11, 2005, qualifies.\\nBasis reduction for corporations.A corporation must reduce the amortizable basis of a pollution control facility by 20% before figuring the amortization deduction.\\nMore information.For more information on the amortization of pollution control facilities, see sections 169 and 291(c) and the related regulations. \\nquestion: 1.

If your average daily production does not exceed your depletable oil or gas quantity, you figure your percentage depletion by multiplying the gross income from the oil or gas property (as defined under _Gross income from the property_, later) by 15% (0.15). If your average daily production of domestic oil or gas exceeds your depletable oil or gas quantity, you must make an allocation as explained later under _Average daily production_.\\nIn addition, there is a limit on the percentage depletion deduction. See _Taxable income limit_, later.\\n**Average daily production.** Figure your average daily production by dividing your total domestic production of oil or gas for the tax year by the number of days in your tax year.\\n**Partial interest.** If you have a partial interest in the production from a property, figure your share of the production by multiplying total production from the property by your percentage participation in the revenues from the property.\\nYou have a partial interest in the production from a property if you have a net profits interest in the property. To figure the share of production for your net profits interest, you must first determine your percentage participation (as measured by the net profits) in the gross revenue from the property. To figure this percentage, you divide the income you receive for your net profits interest by the gross revenue from the property. Then multiply the total production from the property by your percentage participation to figure your share of the production.\\n**Example.** Riley owns oil property in which Finley owns a 20% net profits interest. During the year, the property produced 10,000 barrels of oil, which Riley sold for $200,000. Riley had expenses of $90,000 attributable to the property. The property generated a net profit of $110,000 ($200,000 - $900,000). Finley received income of $22,000 ($110,000 \\\\(\\\\times\\\\) 20% (0.20)) as Finley\\'s net profits interest.\\nThe percentage participation that Finley determined was 11%, figured by dividing $22,000 (income received) by $200,000 (the gross revenue from the property). Finley\\'s share of the oil production was determined to be 1,100 barrels (10,000 barrels \\\\(\\\\times\\\\) 11% (0.11)).\\n**Depitelable oil or natural gas quantity.** Generally, your depletable oil quantity is 1,000 barrels. Your depletable natural gas quantity is 6,000 cubic feet multiplied by the number of barrels of your depletable oil quantity that you choose to apply. If you claim depletion on both oil and natural gas, you must reduce your depletable oil quantity (1,000 barrels) by the number of barrels you use to figure your depletable natural gas quantity.\\n**Example.** You have both oil and natural gas production. To figure your depletable natural gas quantity, you choose to apply 360 barrels of your depletable oil quantity. Your depletable natural gas quantity is 2.16 million cubic feet of gas (360 \\\\(\\\\times\\\\) 6,000). You must reduce your depletable oil quantity to 640 barrels (1,000 - 360).\\nIf you have production from marginal walls, see section 613A(c)(6) to figure your depletable oil or natural gas quantity. See also Notice 2022-24, available at _HS.gov/info/2022-21 IRB_.\\n**Business entities and family members.** You must allocate the depletable oil or gas quantity among the following related persons in proportion to each business entity\\'s or family member\\'s production of domestic oil or gas for the year.\\n* Corporations, trusts, and states if 50% or more of the beneficial interest is owned by the same or related persons (considering only persons that own at least 5% of the beneficial interest).\\n* You and your spouse and minor children.\\n* A related person is anyone mentioned in the related persons discussion under _Nondeductible loss_ in chapter 2 of Pub. 544, except that for purposes of this allocation, item (1) in that discussion includes only an individual, spouse, and their minor children.\\n**Controlled group of corporations.** Members of the same controlled group of corporations are treated as one taxpayer when figuring the depletable oil or natural gas quantity. They share the depletable quantity. A controlled group of corporations is defined in section 1563(a), except that, for this purpose, the stock ownership requirement is \"more than 50%\" rather than \"at least 80%,\" as described in section 1563(a).\\n**Gross income from the property.** For purposes of percentage depletion, gross income from the property (in the case of oil and gas wells) is the amount you receive from the sale of the oil or gas in the immediate vicinity of the well. If you do not sell the oil or gas on the property but manufacture or convert it into a refined product before sale, or transport it before sale, the gross income from the property is the representative market or field price (RMPP) of the oil or gas before conversion or transportation.\\nHowever, if you sold gas after you transported it from the premises for a price that is lower than the RMPP, determine gross income from the property for percentage depletion purposes without regard to the RMPP.\\nGross income from the property does not include lease bonuses, advance royalties, or other amounts payable without regard to production from the property.\\n**Average daily production exceeds depletable quantities. If your average daily production for the year is more than your depletable oil or natural gas quantity, figure your allowance for depletion for each domestic oil or natural gas property as follows.**\\n1. **Figure your average daily production of oil or natural gas for the year.**\\n2. **Figure your depletable oil or natural gas quantity.

The partnership or S corporation makes the allocation as of the date it acquires the oil or gas property.\\nEach member\\'s share of the adjusted basis of the oil or gas property is generally figured according to that partner\\'s interest in partnership capital. However, in some cases, it is figured according to the partner\\'s interest in partnership income.\\nThe partnership or S corporation adjusts the partners or shareholder\\'s share of the adjusted basis of the oil and gas property for any capital expenditures made for the property and for any change in partnership or S corporation interests.\\n**Recordkeeping.** Each partner or shareholder must separately keep records of its share of the adjusted basis in each oil and gas property of the partnership or S corporation. The partner or shareholder must reduce its applicable adjusted basis by the depletion allowed or allowable on the property each year. The partner or shareholder must use that reduced adjusted basis to figure cost depletion, or its gain or loss, if the partnership or S corporation disposes of the property.\\n**Reporting the deduction.** Information that you, as a partner or shareholder, use to figure your depletion deduction on oil and gas properties is reported by the partnership or S corporation on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) or on Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S).

Any bonus or advanced royalty payments are generally part of the gross income from the property to which the rates are applied in making the calculation. However, for oil, gas, or geothermal property, gross income does not include lease pronuses, advanced royalties, or other amounts payable without regard to production from the property.\\n_Ending the lease._ If you receive a bonus on a lease that ends or is abandoned before you derive any income from mineral extraction or the cutting of timber, include in income the depletion deduction you took on the bonus. Do this for the year the lease ends or is abandoned. Also, increase your adjusted basis in the property to restore the depletion deduction you previously subtracted.\\nFor advanced royalties, include in income the depletion claimed on minerals or timber for which the advanced royalties were paid, if the minerals were not produced or timber not cut before the lease ended. Include this amount in income for the year the lease ends. Increase your adjusted basis in the property by the amount you include in income.\\n**Delay rentals.** These are payments for deferring development of the property. Since delay rentals are ordinary rentals are ordinary rentals we are ordinary income to the paye that is not subject to depletion. These rentals can be avoided by either abandoning the lease, beginning development operations, or obtaining production. \\nquestion: 1.

Percentage depletion does not apply to timber. Base your depletion on your cost or other basis in the timber. Your cost does not include the cost of land or any amounts recoverable through depreciation.\\nDepletion takes place when you cut standing timber. You can figure your depletion deduction when the quantity of cut timber is first accurately measured in the process of exploitation.\\n**Figuring cost depletion.** To figure your cost depletion allowance, you multiply the number of timber units cut by your depletion unit.\\n_Timber units._ When you acquire timber property, you must make an estimate of the quantity of marketable timber reasonably known, or on good evidence believed to exist on the property. You measure the timber using feet board measure (FBM), log scale, cords, or other units. If you later determine that you have more or less units of timber, you must adjust the original estimate.\\nThe term \"timber property\" means your economic interest in standing timber in each tract or block representing a separate timber account.\\n_Depletion unit._ You figure your depletion unit each year by taking the following steps.\\n1. Determine your cost or adjusted basis of the timber on hand at the beginning of the year. Adjusted basis is defined under _Cost Depletion_ in the discussion on _Mineral Property_, earlier.\\n2. Add to the amount determined in (1) the cost of any timber units acquired during the year and any additions to capital.\\n3. Figure the number of timber units to take into account by adding the number of timber units acquired during the year to the number of timber units on hand in the account at the beginning of the year and then adding (or subtracting) any correction to the estimate of the number of timber units remaining in the account.\\n4. Divide the result of (2) by the result of (3). This is your depletion unit.\\n_Example._ You bought a timber tract for $160,000 and the land was worth as much as the timber. Your basis for the timber is $80,000. Based on an estimated 1 million feet board measure (FBM) or 1,000 \"thousand board feet\" (MFBM) of standing timber, you figure your depletion unit to be $80 per MFBM ($80,000 + 1,000). If you cut 500 MFBM of timber, your depletion allowance would be $40,000 (500 \\\\(\\\\mathrm{MFBM}\\\\times\\\\mathrm{S}\\\\mathrm{S}\\\\mathrm{0}\\\\)).\\n**When to claim depletion.** Claim your depletion allowance as a deduction in the year of sale or other disposition of the products cut from the timber, unless you choose to treat the cutting of timber as a sale or exchange (explained below). Include allowable depletion for timber products not sold during the tax year the timber is cut as a cost item in the closing inventory of timber products for the year. The inventory is your basis for determining gain or loss in the tax year you sell the timber products.\\n_Example._ The facts are the same as in the previous example, except that you seldom only half of the timber products in the cutting year. You would deduct $20,000 of the $40,000 depletion that year. You would add the remaining $20,000 depletion to your closing inventory of timber products.\\n**Electing to treat the cutting of timber as a sale or exchange.** You can elect, under certain circumstances, to treat the cutting of timber held for more than 1 year as a sale or exchange. You must make the election on your income tax return for the tax year to which it applies. The election can\\'t be made on an amended return. If you make this election, subtract the adjusted basis for depletion from the fair market value (FBM) of the timber on the first day of the tax year in which you cut it to figure the gain or loss on the cutting. You generally report the gain as long-term capital gain. The FBM then becomes your basis for figuring your ordinary gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of the products cut from the timber. For more information, see _Timber_ in chapter 2 of Pub. 544.\\nYou may revoke an election to treat the cutting of timber as a sale or exchange, without the IRS\\'s consent, by the due (including extensions) for the return. The prior election (and revocation) is disregarded for purposes of making a subsequent election. See Form T (Timber, Forest Activities Schedule) for more information.\\n**Form T (Timber, Forest Activities Schedule).** Complete and attach Form T (Timber, Forest Activities Schedule) to your income tax return if you claim a deduction for timber depletion, choose to treat the cutting of timber as a sale or exchange, or make an outright sale of timber. \\nquestion: 1.

Goods that have been sold, but not yet paid for, and services that have been performed, but not yet paid for, are recorded in your books as either accounts receivable or notes receivable. After a reasonable period of time, if you have tried to collect the amount due, but are unable to do so, the uncollectible part of the receivables becomes a business bad debt.\\nAccounts or notes receivable valued at fair market value (F/M) when received are deductible only at that value, even though the F/M may be less than the face value. If you purchased an account receivable for less than its face value, and the receivable subsequently becomes worthless, the most youre allowed to deduct is the amount you paid to acquire it.\\nYou can claim a business bad debt deduction only if the amount owed to you varies was previously included in gross income.

For more information, see Regulations section 1.166-3(a)(3).\\n_Deduction disallowed._ Generally, you can claim a partial bad debt deduction only in the year you make the charge-off on your books. If, under audit, the IRS doesn\\'t allow your deduction and the debt becomes partly worthless in a later tax year, you can deduct the amount you charged off in that year plus the disallowed amount charged off in the earlier year. The charge-off in the earlier year, unless reversed on your books, fulfills the charge-off requirement for the later year.\\n**Totally worthless debts.** If a debt becomes totally worthless in the current tax year, you can deduct the entire amount minus any amount deducted in an earlier tax year when the debt was only partly worthless.\\nYou don\\'t have to make an actual charge-off on your books to claim a bad debt deduction for a totally worthless debt. However, you may want to do so. If you don\\'t and the IRS later are about deduct that did not reduce your tax. Report the _recovery_ as \"Other income\" on the appropriate business form or schedule.\\n_See Recoveries_ in Pub. 525 for more information.\\n_NOL carryover._ If a bad debt deduction increases an NOL carryover that has not expired before the beginning of the tax year in which the recovery takes place, you treat the deduction as having reduced your tax. A bad debt deduction that contributes to an NOL helps lower taxes in the year to which you carry the NOL. For more information about NOLs for individuals, see Pub. 536.

In these cases, your employee is considered to have accounted to you for the amount of the expense that doesn't exceed the rates established by the federal government. Your employee must actually substantiate to you the other elements of the expense, such as time, place, and business purpose.\\nFederal rate The federal rate can be figured using any one of the following methods.\\n1. For car expenses: 1. The standard mileage rate. 2. A fixed and variable rate (FAVR).\\n2. For per diem amounts: 1. The regular federal per diem rate. 2. The standard meal allowance. 3. The high-low rate.\\nCar allowance Your employee is considered to have accounted to you for car expenses that don't exceed the standard mileage rate. For tax year 2022, the standard business mileage rate is:\\n* 58.5 cents per mile for January 1, 2022, through June 30, 2022; and\\n* 62.5 cents per mile for July 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022.\\nTo find the standard mileage rate for 2023, go to _IRS.gov/Tax-Professionals/Standard-Mieage-Bates_.\\nYou can choose to reimburse your employees using an FAVR allowance. This is an allowance that includes a combination of payments covering fixed and variable costs, such as a cents-per-mile rate to cover your employees' variable operating costs (such as gas, oil, etc.) plus a flat amount to cover your employees' fixed costs (such as depreciation, insurance, etc.). For information on using an FAVR allowance, see Revenue Procedure 2019-46, available at _IRS.gov/itb2019-49_ /_IRB.gov/itb/2022-02_ /_IRB_.\\nPer diem allowance If your employee actually substantiates to you the other elements (discussed earlier) of the expenses reimbursed using the per diem allowance, how you report and deduct the allowance depends on whether the allowance is for lodging and meal expenses or for meal expenses only and whether the allowance is more than the federal rate.\\nRegular federal per diem rate The regular federal per diem rate is the highest amount the federal government will pay to its employees while away from home on travel. It has the following two components.\\n1. Lodging expense.\\n2. Meal and incidental expenses (M&IE).\\nThe rates are different for different locations. See _GSA.gov/erdiem_ for the per diem rates in the continental United States.\\nStandard meal allowance The federal rate for M&IE is the standard meal allowance. You can pay only on M&IE allowance to employees who travel away from home it:\\n* You pay the employee for actual expenses per diem and car allowances. The manner in which you report them depends on how the allowance compares to the federal rate. See _Tax_: lodging 11-1.\\nAllowance less than or equal to the federal rate If you allowance for the employee is less than or equal to the appropriate federal rate, that allowance isn't included as part of the employee's pay in box 1 of the employee's Form W-2. Deduct the allowance as travel expenses (including meals that may be subject to the 50% limit, discussed later). See _How to deduct under Accountable Plans_, earlier.\\n_Allowance more than the federal rate._ If your employee's allowance is more than the appropriate federal rate, you must report the allowance as two separate items.\\nInclude the allowance amount up to the federal rate in box 12 (code L) of the employee's Form W-2. Deduct it as travel expenses (explained above). This part of the allowance is treated as reimbursed under an accountable plan.\\nInclude the amount that is more than the federal rate in box 1 (and in boxes 3 and 5 if they apply) of the employees' Form W-2. Deduct it as ways subject to income tax withholding, social security, Medicare, and federal unemployment taxes. This part of the allowance is treated as reimbursed under a nonaccountable plan (explained later) under Nonaccountable Plans. \\nquestion: 1. What method should be used to determine the federal rate for car expenses?\\n2. Can I use both the standard mileage rate and FAVR allowance for my employees at the same time?\\n3. How do I calculate the standard meal allowance for per diem reimbursements?\\n4. Where can I find the current high-low rates for per diem allowances?\\n5. Is there a difference between reporting a car allowance and a per diem allowance on an employee's Form W-2?\\n6. What happens when an employee's per diem allowance is less than the federal rate?\\n7. Do I need to provide proof of the business purpose for each expense reimbursed under an accountable plan?\\n8. Are there any special rules for reporting and deducting per diem allowances for foreign travel?\\n9. How often should I update the standard mileage rate for my company's accounting purposes?\\n10. Can I set up an FAVR allowance for just the fixed costs of owning a vehicle, or does it also include variable costs?\\n11. What documentation should I require from employees to support their expenses reimbursed under an accountable plan?\\n12. Are there any penalties for failing to follow the rules for accountable plans related to per diem and car allowances?\\n13. Does the treatment of a per diem or car allowance as reimbursed under an accountable plan or a nonaccountable plan affect the employee's tax liability?\\n14. Can I offer a higher per diem rate to certain employees without violating the rules for accountable plans?\\n15. How might changes in federal per diem rates impact my company's budget and financial planning processes?\"],\n",

Use them.\\nYou can find a list of your rights and the IRS\\'s obligations to protect them in _Pub.L.Y. Your Rights as a Taxayer_. It includes the following.\\n1. **The Right To Be Informed.** Taxayers have the right to know what they need to do to comply with the tax laws. They are entitled to clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. They have the right to be informed of IRS decisions about their tax accounts and to receive clear explanations of the outcomes.\\n2. **The Right to Quality Service.** Taxayers have the right to receive prompt, courous, and professional assistance in their dealings with the IRS, to be spoken to in a way they can easily understand, to receive clear and easily understandable communications from the IRS, and to speak to a supervisor about inadequate service.\\n3. **The Right To Pay No More Than the Correct Amount of Tax.** Taxayers have the right to expect the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due, including interest and penalties, and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly.\\n4. **The Right To Challenge the IRS\\'s Position and Be Head.** Taxayers have the right to raise objections and provide additional documentation in response to formal IRS actions or proposed actions, to expect that the IRS will consider their timely objections and documentation promptly and fairly, and to receive a response if the IRS does not agree with their position.\\n5. **The Right To Appeal an IRS Decision in an Independent Forum.** Taxayers are entitled to a fair and impartial administrative appeal of most IRS decisions, including many penalties, and have the right to receive a written response regarding the Office of Appeals\\' decision.

Taxayers have the right to expect appropriate action will be taken against employees, return prepares, and others who wrongfully use or disclose taxpayer return information.\\n9. **The Right To Retain Representation.** Taxayers have the right to retain an authorized representative of their choice to represent them in their dealings with the IRS. Taxayers have the right to seek assistance from a Low Income Taxayer Clinic if they cannot afford representation.\\n10. **The Right to a Fair and Just Tax System.** Taxayers have the right to expect the tax system to consider facts and circumstances that might affect their underlying liabilities, ability to pay, or ability to provide information timely.
