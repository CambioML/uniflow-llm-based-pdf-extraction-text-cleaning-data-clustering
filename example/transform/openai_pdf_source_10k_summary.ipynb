    "# Example of generating summaries for a 10K\n",
    "In this example, we will show you how to generate page summaries from a pdf using OpenAI's models via `uniflow`'s [OpenAIJsonModelFlow](https://github.com/CambioML/uniflow/blob/main/uniflow/flow/model_flow.py#L125).\n",

    "For this example, we're using a [10K from Nike](https://investors.nike.com/investors/news-events-and-reports/).\n",

    "\n",
    "You will need to `uniflow` conda environment to run this notebook. You can set up the environment following the instruction: https://github.com/CambioML/uniflow/tree/main#installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will need a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to run the code. Once you have the key, set it as the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` within a `.env` file in the root directory of this repository. For more details, see this [instruction](https://github.com/CambioML/uniflow/tree/main#api-keys)\n",
