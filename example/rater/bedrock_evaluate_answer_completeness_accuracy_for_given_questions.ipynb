You can set up the profile by running `aws configure --profile <profile_name>` in your terminal. You will need to provide your AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key. You can find your AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key in the [Security Credentials](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/security_credentials) section of the AWS console.\n",
