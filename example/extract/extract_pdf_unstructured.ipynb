We show that a simple CNN with lit- tle hyperparameter tuning and static vec- tors achieves excellent results on multi- ple benchmarks. Learning task-speciﬁc vectors through ﬁne-tuning offers further gains in performance. We additionally propose a simple modiﬁcation to the ar- chitecture to allow for the use of both task-speciﬁc and static vectors.

       "     'Deep learning models have achieved remarkable results in computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and speech recognition (Graves et al., 2013) in recent years. Within natural language process- ing, much of the work with deep learning meth- ods has involved learning word vector representa- tions through neural language models (Bengio et al., 2003; Yih et al., 2011; Mikolov et al., 2013) and performing composition over the learned word vectors for classiﬁcation (Collobert et al., 2011). Word vectors, wherein words are projected from a sparse, 1-of-V encoding (here V is the vocabulary size) onto a lower dimensional vector space via a hidden layer, are essentially feature extractors that encode semantic features of words in their dimen- sions. In such dense representations, semantically close words are likewise close—in euclidean or cosine distance—in the lower dimensional vector space.',\n",

Originally invented for computer vision, CNN models have subsequently been shown to be effective for NLP and have achieved excellent results in semantic parsing (Yih et al., 2014), search query retrieval (Shen et al., 2014), sentence modeling (Kalch- brenner et al., 2014), and other traditional NLP tasks (Collobert et al., 2011).',\n",
       "     'In the present work, we train a simple CNN with one layer of convolution on top of word vectors obtained from an unsupervised neural language model. These vectors were trained by Mikolov et al. (2013) on 100 billion words of Google News, and are publicly available.1 We initially keep the word vectors static and learn only the other param- eters of the model. Despite little tuning of hyper- parameters, this simple model achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks, suggesting that the pre-trained vectors are ‘universal’ feature ex- tractors that can be utilized for various classiﬁca- tion tasks. Learning task-speciﬁc vectors through ﬁne-tuning results in further improvements. We ﬁnally describe a simple modiﬁcation to the archi- tecture to allow for the use of both pre-trained and task-speciﬁc vectors by having multiple channels. Our work is philosophically similar to Razavian et al. (2014) which showed that for image clas- siﬁcation, feature extractors obtained from a pre- trained deep learning model perform well on a va- riety of tasks—including tasks that are very dif- ferent from the original task for which the feature extractors were trained.',\n",
